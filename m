The arch_freq_get_on_cpu that is using AMU counters on ARM is also bound to
a tick - this is still the average over a tick period.
Now it is not exactly current frequency as seen by hardware but gives a good
estimate as of what is happening under the hood.
I guess the question would be: what is the use of instant read on hw freq for
userspace tools if, as mentioned already, the freq can change at any point of
time so it is rather cumbersome to reason about. Once the userspace gets that
info it might be no longer valid.

It is very platform specific - and even if there is a way to get a feedback on
every freq change - again what userspace is supposed to do when it gets stale
data?
