Hi Daniel,

Sorry for the delay.

Unfortunately, it is not perfect.

I have no objections to the first 3 patches, so please feel free to
add ACKs from me to those.

However, patch [4/8] is questionable IMV, so please drop it for now.
I'll send my comments to it separately later today.

All of the int340* patches need ACKs from Srinivas, who was not
included in the CC of the original submission AFAICS, before they can
be pushed to linux-next.
