commit 58b116bce136 is from 2014 and the whole ULPI support for dwc3
came in a year later.
While I agree that 58b116bce136 fail to handle came a year later, but
technically it did not introduced a regression.

The revert on the other hand is going to introduce a regression as
things were working fine since 2014. Not sure why the dwc3 issue got
this long to be noticed as the 58b116bce136 was already in kernel when
the ULPI support was added...

Fwiw my original approach was a bit different:
https://lore.kernel.org/patchwork/patch/454800/

Greg changed it to what ended up in the kernel:
