That block is conditioned by pci_match_id() so I don't think it would 
execute.

The block that prints "retraining failed" is the one which attempts to 
restore the old Target Link Speed. TLS seems to also be set to 8GT/s as 
per the lspci from Niklas which is another inconsistency in the config 
space.

Although, I'd tend to think if these trigger the quirk/retraining now, 
kernel has done some retraining for these links prior to bwctrl was added, 
so perhaps that 8GT/s TLS is not going to be found as the culprit.

What could be tried though is to not do the LBMIE enabled at all which is 
one clearly new thing which comes with bwctrl. Commenting out the calls to 
pcie_bwnotif_enable() should achieve that.

I recall taking note of this inconsistency in some lspci dumps I've from 
Mika (but forgot it until now). So I'm afraid it might be more widespread 
than just TR.
