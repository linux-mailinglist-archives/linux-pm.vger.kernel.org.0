According to the spec, "Software is permitted to restrict the maximum speed
of Link operation and set the perferred Link speed by setting the value in the
Target Link Speed field in the Upstream component." - This is the Link Control
2 Register, and a link retrain should then be triggered.

With regards to this proposed sysfs API - I wonder if this implies we should
also disable 'Hardware Autonomous Speed Disable' to prevent a link speed
change for device specific reasons?

In my view, this means we *can* have a sysfs control for limiting the link
speed using standard PCI means - though callbacks and quirks may be needed
for host bridge controllers and similar.

With regards to link width, I can't see any obvious software initiated means
to change the link width (they are all RO) - though a device can change its
own link width so long as it's 'Hardware Autonomous Width Disable' bit is
clear. So whilst there may be some benefit for the initial links of a few
host bridge controllers that may opt-in to some framework for this - such an
API wouldn't benefit the majority of links in a PCI fabric. Perhaps this
(width) should be DWC specific.
