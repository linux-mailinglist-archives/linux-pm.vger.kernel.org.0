My reading on this (and I might be wrong) is that for x86,
arch_freq_get_on_cpu() is utilizing the APERF/MPERF registers to get
a rough/average frequency and as such it does, in a way, get a hw feedback
and it does somewhat fall under "frequency the hardware actually runs at".
Because it is an average value, it might not provide an instant view on
current frequency, but either way, the value provided here migh be a bit off
anyway. But then, we could adjust the timewidnow being used to make it more
accurate. I might be looking at it the wrong way though.

What's your take on leaving the scaling_cur_freq to resolve to
arch_freq_get_on_cpu() when cpuinfo_cur_freq is not present ?
This way nothing will change for the intel_pstate + HWP
but it will allow using the info provided by arch_freq_get_on_cpu() for
cpuinfo_cur_freq if one is provided and it will automatically ignore it for
scaling_cur_freq ? Though I guess it falls under "making all confused" that you
have described donw the line.

What would introducing new attribute mean for scaling_cur_freq on x86 then ?
I do assume we would leave cpuinfo_cur_freq untouched without calling
arch_freq_get_on_cpu() (as it is now). Then keeping scaling_cur_freq to actually
use it - what would be the 3rd attribute meaning, if:
- cpuinfo_cur_freq -> actual freq as seen by the hardware (but not the
  counters?)
- scaling_cur_freq -> last requested frequency and for some cases, feedback from
  counters
- whatever_name_we_will_come_with -> average frequency based on counters ?
  not always available

 It is still bit confusing.
