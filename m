I understand and that's exactly what I had pointed out earlier when I
mentioned that I had raised this concern previously.

I disagree, it was made inevitable by not listening to all feedback, sorry.

I don't completely understand this TBH. Also my main worry is as we move more
towards abstract scale and/or index based, any addition or deletion of OPPs
results in change in the index or scale. It may be dealt on absolute scale
today everywhere and not a problem *today*, but it will break IMO.

Nope, I meant the firmware updates the OPP table underneath for whatever
valid reasons it may have.

OK that's interesting. I wanted to fetch the exact list from the hardware
every time.

IMO the cross dependency is one part of problem and fetching the exact list
of OPPs available for the CPU is another. I meant to fix the latter in boot
code. The former is something I assume DT bindings deals with.

Sure, definitely I am just expressing my concern with NACK and I don't have
the final say üòÅ.
