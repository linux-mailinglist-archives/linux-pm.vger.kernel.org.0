Of course.  It just relies on the implicit assumption that the bit in
the error response matches the PME_STATUS state that we want, which is
a little bit ugly.

Agreed, that's the conclusion I came to as well.  I wouldn't do this
just to avoid the config write, since as you mentioned that will get
dropped anyway.  The reason I would consider this is as an example of
how drivers might think about validating data they read from devices.
