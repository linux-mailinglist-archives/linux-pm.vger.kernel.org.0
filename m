Yes it is but the fact that allow then reduces usage count too even more=20
so. I understand it's necessary for allowing the functionality but I hope=
=20
you can see how illogical it sounds that usage suddenly is less because of=
=20
an user action through sysfs, it just defies normal reasoning (no offense=
=20

It would be useful to improve the wording in PM documentation which is too=
=20
ambiguous. I suggest changing this:

"void pm_runtime_forbid(struct device *dev);

unset the power.runtime_auto flag for the device and increase its
usage counter (used by the /sys/devices/.../power/control interface to=20
effectively prevent the device from being power managed at run time).

to:

"... (used to prevent the device from being power managed at run time=20
until pm_runtime_allow() or /sys/devices/.../power/control interface=20
allows it)."


I have to admit I'd still end up thinking usage count remains 1 up at this=
=20
point (if not knowing better like I do now) but at least it would
unambiguously tells what the interface does.


My another point related to whether that confusing usage count decrement=20
(solely because of user action) is worth describing in the changelog of=20
this patch (or v2 of it which follows your suggestion on moving enable=20
locatoon). IMO, it's odd/confusing enough a note would be warranted.
I know it after this discussion, obviously, but I worry over others who=20
trip over the same thing if somebody else has to look over this change.
