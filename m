Even if it did that, it wouldn't have been a full list almost for sure.

We had received multiple problem reports related to that, most likely
because the ACPI PM in BIOSes at that time was tailored for
system-wide PM transitions only.

The systems that had those problems 10 years ago would still have
them, but I expect there to be more systems where runtime PM can be
enabled by default for PCI devices without issues.
