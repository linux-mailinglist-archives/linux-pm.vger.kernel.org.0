Neither of them, supposedly.  Now I took a deeper look at the code
around it and dug into the git log, and found that the likely problem
was the recent PCI core code refactoring (removal of pci->driver, etc)
that have been already reverted; that was why linux-next-20211109 was
broken and linux-next-20211110 worked.  With the leftover pci->driver,
the stale runtime PM callback was called at the pm_runtime_put_sync()
call in pci_device_remove().

In anyway, I'll drop the invalid calls of pm_runtime_enable() /
disable() & co.  Maybe keeping pm_runtime_forbid() and
pm_runtime_dont_use_autosuspend() at remove still makes some sense as
a counter-part for the probe calls, though.


thanks,

Takashi
