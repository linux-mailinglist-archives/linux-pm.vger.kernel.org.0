It's exciting to see this proposal materilizing :)

I didn't get a chance to look too closely at the code, but I have a few
high-level comments.

Do we need separate refcnt and swap_count? I am aware that there are
cases where we need to hold a reference to prevent the descriptor from
going away, without an extra page table entry referencing the swap
descriptor -- but I am wondering if we can get away by just incrementing
the swap count in these cases too? Would this mess things up?

I know this is easier, but honestly I'd prefer if we do an incremental
replacement (if possible) rather than introducing a new implementation
and slowly deprecating the old one, which historically doesn't seem to
go well :P

Once the series is organized as Johannes suggested, and we have better
insights into how this will be integrated with Kairui's work, it should
be clearer whether it's possible to incrementally update the current
implemetation rather than add a parallel implementation.

I thought there would be some improvements with the new design once the
lock contention is gone, due to the colocation of all swap metadata. Do
we know why this isn't the case?

Also, one missing key metric in this cover letter is disk space savings.
It would be useful if you can give a realistic example about how much
disk space is being provisioned and wasted today to effictively use
zswap, and how much this can decrease with this design.

I believe the disk space savings are one of the main motivations so
let's showcase that :)
