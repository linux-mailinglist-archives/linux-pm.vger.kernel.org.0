That's interesting — we've explored a similar idea as well, 
although not by attaching it to ZRAM.
Instead, our concept involved creating a separate block device 
capable of performing the tiering functionality, and using it as follows:

1. Prepare a block device that can manage multiple backend block devices.
2. Perform swapon on this block device.
3. Within the block device, use cgroup awareness 
to carry out tiered swap operations across the prepared backend devices.

However, we ended up postponing this approach as a second-tier option, mainly 
due to the following concerns:

1. The idea of allocating physical slots but managing them internally 
as logical slots felt inefficient.
2. Embedding cgroup awareness within a block device 
seemed like a layer violation.

I am in agreement with the points you’ve made.

I have been exploring an interface design 
that leverages the existing swap priority mechanism,
and I believe it would be valuable 
to share this for further discussion and feedback.
As mentioned in my earlier response to Nhat,
I intend to submit this as an RFC to solicit broader input from the community.
