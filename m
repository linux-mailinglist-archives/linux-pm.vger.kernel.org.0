Drivers having both legacy callbacks and modern callbacks (including
runtime PM callbacks) cause emission of a WARN splat in
pci_has_legacy_pm_support().

Drivers need to activate runtime PM by dropping a runtime PM reference
on probe (see the code comment in local_pci_probe()).  In theory a
driver could have legacy callbacks but no modern callbacks and still
use runtime PM by calling pm_runtime_put_noidle() on probe.  So I
compiled a list of drivers implementing legacy callbacks (included
at the end of this e-mail for reference), grep'ed through them
for any "pm_runtime" occurrences and found none.

Hence it seems very unlikely that drivers using legacy callbacks and
runtime PM exist.  We probably shouldn't accommodate for such use cases
but should rather try to incentivize conversion to modern callbacks.

When compiling the list I sadly noticed that new drivers do exist
which use legacy callbacks.  A case in point is:

drivers/net/ethernet/google/gve/gve_main.c

... which started using legacy callbacks in 2021 with commit 974365e51861
("gve: Implement suspend/resume/shutdown").

I guess there is no real incentive to convert to modern PM callbacks and
finding someone who has the hardware and can test patches is hard
(most drivers are for ATA, some for really old 1990s hardware).
Plus, a lot of detailed knowledge about PCI PM is necessary to avoid
breakage, making this a task that can't easily be delegated to new
contributors.  And everyone with the knowledge is overworked already.
So we keep dragging this tech debt along which complicates codepaths. :(

Right.  To have a consistent logic that state_saved is always cleared
before commencing the suspend sequence, in all codepaths.

Perfect.

Exactly right.

FWIW, this is the sequence of suspend-to-memory, obviously much simpler:

  pci_pm_prepare()
  pci_pm_suspend()
  pci_pm_suspend_late()
  pci_pm_suspend_noirq()
  pci_pm_resume_noirq()
  pci_pm_resume_early()
  pci_pm_resume()
  pci_pm_complete()

And runtime PM:

  pci_pm_runtime_suspend()
  pci_pm_runtime_resume()

Thanks,

Lukas
