IIUC this is because the loop that checks which states support PME
starts with D3hot and doesn't even look at D3cold.

I've spent quite a bit of time trying to understand this, and I'm kind
of dragging my feet on it because I haven't been able to really
connect this with the specs.  It also seems unfortunate to have to add
this special case in two places.

It seems like we're basically lying and *saying* we're going to put
the device in D3hot, but due to some magic invisible assumption, we
*actually* put it in D3cold.

Nit 1: "if (target_state == PCI_D3hot && ...) return target_state;"
means "if (...) return PCI_D3hot;".  When we're returning a constant
value that we already know, I think it's clearer to use the constant.

Nit 2: it looks like both these tests should use pci_pme_capable(),
which would match the other special case in __pci_enable_wake().
