PCIe controller can do certain actions like keeping low power state, 
remove bandwidth votes etc as part of runtime suspend as when we know
the client drivers already runtime suspended.

No we are having a different observations here.
Without this change the PCIe controller driver can go to runtime suspend 
without considering the state of the client drivers i.e even when the
client drivers are active.
After adding this change we see the pcie controller is getting runtime
suspended only after the client drivers are runtime suspended which is
the expected behaviour.
