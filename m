At this point in the code, setting dev->current_state based on the
value of PCI_PM_CTRL seems reasonable.  We're making the pci_dev state
match the PCI device hardware state.  This paragraph sort of implies
we're missing an "appropriate platform power transition" here, but I
don't think that's the case.

But it would be nice if we could combine this bit from
pci_enable_device_flags() with the pci_set_power_state() in
do_pci_enable_device().

So some ACPI power regions are in fact "on" (because the PCI device
that requires them is in D0), but the ACPI core believes them to be
"off" (or probably "unknown, treated as 'off'")?

I added Rafael & linux-pm because he should chime in here.
