So this is a preliminary step.  That was unclear to me.

You can say so, but that's how it goes.

If there are any devices with runtime PM disabled in a dependency
chain, the runtime PM framework cannot follow that chain as a whole.
If enabling runtime PM for a device leads to this situation, it is not
correct.

I think that you can enable runtime PM for host bridge devices in
general, as long as they don't need to be resumed without resuming any
of their children.

If that's the case, resuming one of its children will also cause the
host bridge to resume and all should be fine, although you also need
to ensure that system-wide suspend handling is in agreement with this.

I would suggest calling pm_runtime_no_callbacks() for the host bridge devic=
e.

> [1] https://lore.kernel.org/all/20240307215505.GA632869@bhelgaas/

And this is the information to put into your patch changelog:

1. It is a property of the runtime PM framework that it can only
follow continuous dependency chains.  That is, if there is a device
with runtime PM disabled in a dependency chain, runtime PM cannot be
enabled for devices below it and above it in that chain both at the
same time.

2. Because of the above, in order to enable runtime PM for a PCIe
controller device, one needs to ensure that runtime PM is enabled for
all devices in every dependency chain between it and any PCIe endpoint
(as runtime PM is enabled for PCIe endpoints).

3. This means that runtime PM needs to be enabled for the host bridge
device, which is present in all of these dependency chains.

4. After this change, the host bridge device will be runtime-suspended
by the runtime PM framework automatically after suspending its last
child and it will be runtime-resumed automatically before resuming its
first child which will allow the runtime PM framework to track
dependencies between the host bridge device and all of its
descendants.

Thanks!
