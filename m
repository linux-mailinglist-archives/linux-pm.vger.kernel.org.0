will add the check, thanks

I left it untouched to reduce changes, but I see your point.

I don't see that error, and that's also why I left it there. If there's already
and em_pd for a device, EM just returns with an error that we don't check.

I agree that it makes more sense to register em for opp_shared_cpus.
