Yeah, so thinking about it indeed feels a bit like we are changing the 
DT here to cater for some Linux implementation detail. After all we 
already access the regmap successfully in dwmac-sun8i.c, is that 
approach frowned upon (because: driver model) and just tolerated because 
it's already in the code base?

So do you mean to either just remove the explicit syscon compatible 
check in syscon_node_to_regmap(), or replace it with a check against a 
list of allowed devices?
Wouldn't it be sufficient to leave that check to the (syscon-like) 
devices, by them exporting a regmap in the first place or not? And we 
can do filtering of accesses there, like we do in sunxi_sram.c?

Cheers,
Andre
