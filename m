Maybe it's moot because we hope there will be no new users of PCI
legacy PM with runtime PM, but I don't think there's anything to
*prevent* that or to protect against out-of-tree drivers.

The implicit assumption that there are no such drivers makes it look
like there's something magic involving state_saved, legacy PM, and
runtime PM.  It might be worth doing the same in the legacy PM path
just for readability.

Stepping back, I guess that when drivers use generic PM, we already
save config state during suspend and restore that state during resume,
and do the same when entering/leaving hibernation.

And the point of this patch is to do the same when drivers lack PM or
use legacy PCI PM, or when devices have no driver?

Maybe third try is the charm?

  For drivers using PCI legacy suspend, save config state at suspend
  so that state, not any earlier state from enumeration, probe, or
  error recovery, will be restored when resuming.

  For devices with no driver or a driver that lacks PM, save config
  state at hibernate so that state, not any earlier state from
  enumeration, probe, or error recovery, will be restored when
  resuming.

IIUC, after "Ensure error recoverability", the PCI core will always
save the state during enumeration, so drivers shouldn't use
pci_save_state() at all unless they make config changes that they want
restored during error recovery?

Or, I guess (sigh) if they do their own power management?

Thanks, this is extremely helpful.  Copied into my notes.  I guess
this is essentially condensed from
Documentation/driver-api/pm/devices.rst, but it's very helpful to see
the bare bones and your annotations.
