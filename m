Georgi, can you collect the complete dmesg log and "sudo lspci
-vvxxxx" output somewhere?  A new report at bugzilla.kernel.org would
be a good spot.

Maybe we're missing a delay here.  The "config space inaccessible"
message means we read 0xffff from PCI_PM_CTRL, which probably means
the device is still in D3cold.  If it were in any other power state,
PCI_PM_CTRL should be readable, and 0xffff is not a valid value.

Could you also insert a dump_stack() right after we print that "config
space inaccessible" message?  I don't know enough about power
management to understand why we see that message twice.
