This cover letter was not clear enough. In fact, the context for
all patches I am sending now and will be sending in near future
is when the thermal subsystem is configured to control temperature
of a target device. The thermal subsystem is configured to have
cooling devices that will act on the target system, and has
input, temperature sensors, to have visibility to the target system
temperature.  In this case, the problem is when the controlling system
becomes unresponsive upon reboot or crash, therefore losing
control of temperature of the target system. This series solves the
problem by giving knowledge to the governors of such events, allowing
the governors to have opportunity to act before the actual event happens.
