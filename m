Sounds good.

So this basically would be an interface for user space to add a trip
point at run time?

What about a "send me an event if the temperature is equal to this"
interface instead?

But yes, as a discussion topic this would be fine.

OK

Sounds good, but it is kind of minor with respect to the above.  We'll see.
