>> III. Usage and Benchmarking
>>
>> This patch series introduce no new syscalls or userspace API. Existing
>> userspace setups will work as-is, except we no longer have to create a
>> swapfile or set memory.swap.max if we want to use zswap, as zswap is no
>> longer tied to physical swap. The zswap pool will be automatically and
>> dynamically sized based on memory usage and reclaim dynamics.
>>
>> To measure the performance of the new implementation, I have run the
>> following benchmarks:
>>
>> 1. Kernel building: 52 workers (one per processor), memory.max = 3G.
>>
>> Using zswap as the backend:
>>
>> Baseline:
>> real: mean: 185.2s, stdev: 0.93s
>> sys: mean: 683.7s, stdev: 33.77s
>>
>> Vswap:
>> real: mean: 184.88s, stdev: 0.57s
>> sys: mean: 675.14s, stdev: 32.8s
>>
>> We actually see a slight improvement in systime (by 1.5%) :) This is
>> likely because we no longer have to perform swap charging for zswap
>> entries, and virtual swap allocator is simpler than that of physical
>> swap.
>>
>> Using SSD swap as the backend:
>>
>> Baseline:
>> real: mean: 200.3s, stdev: 2.33s
>> sys: mean: 489.88s, stdev: 9.62s
>>
>> Vswap:
>> real: mean: 201.47s, stdev: 2.98s
>> sys: mean: 487.36s, stdev: 5.53s
>>
>> The performance is neck-to-neck.
>>
>>
>> IV. Future Use Cases
>>
>> While the patch series focus on two applications (decoupling swap
>> backends and swapoff optimization/simplification), this new,
>> future-proof design also allows us to implement new swap features more
>> easily and efficiently:
>>
>> * Multi-tier swapping (as mentioned in [5]), with transparent
>>    transferring (promotion/demotion) of pages across tiers (see [8] and
>>    [9]). Similar to swapoff, with the old design we would need to
>>    perform the expensive page table walk.
>> * Swapfile compaction to alleviate fragmentation (as proposed by Ying
>>    Huang in [6]).
>> * Mixed backing THP swapin (see [7]): Once you have pinned down the
>>    backing store of THPs, then you can dispatch each range of subpages
>>    to appropriate backend swapin handler.
>> * Swapping a folio out with discontiguous physical swap slots
>>    (see [10]).
>> * Zswap writeback optimization: The current architecture pre-reserves
>>    physical swap space for pages when they enter the zswap pool, giving
>>    the kernel no flexibility at writeback time. With the virtual swap
>>    implementation, the backends are decoupled, and physical swap space
>>    is allocated on-demand at writeback time, at which point we can make
>>    much smarter decisions: we can batch multiple zswap writeback
>>    operations into a single IO request, allocating contiguous physical
>>    swap slots for that request. We can even perform compressed writeback
>>    (i.e writing these pages without decompressing them) (see [12]).

Are you CCing all maintainers that get_maintainers.pl suggests you to cc?
