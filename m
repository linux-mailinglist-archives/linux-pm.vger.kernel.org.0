While we don't know exactly what happens when the platform firmware is
running, we can reasonably expect that devices will get reset as a
result of that.

It's kind of like heating up things in a microwave oven: you don't
need to know exactly what happens when it is working, but nevertheless
you can predict with quite high confidence what the outcome of that
will be.

In general, that may or may not be the case.

I guess it is the case here, because Lukas seems to know how to make
this work, but the AML in question might be prepared with the
assumption that the firmware code finalizing the transition will run
after it.

Actually both the suspend and resume paths in it together, but the
important piece is that if the firmware runs at the end of suspend, it
will also run at the beginning of resume.

That's right.

The rule of thumb is to use pm_suspend_via_firmware() in the
system-wide suspend code paths and pm_resume_via_firmware() in the
resume ones.  They are simply complementary.

And because in this particular case a decision needs to be made
whether or not to do something in a suspend path, the former is the
right one to use.

Right.
