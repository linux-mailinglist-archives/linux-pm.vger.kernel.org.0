I didn't say it was the only way to address the issue, just that it's
the only way to make sure that the new warning gets addressed. Once code
is upstream, some vendors tend to lose interest.

After taking a closer look now, I agree that the underlying issue seems
to be in PM core.

Possibly introduced by Rafael's commit 6e176bf8d461 ("PM: sleep: core:
Do not skip callbacks in the resume phase") which moved the set_active()
call from resume_noirq() to resume_early().

My point was simply that this commit introduced a new warning in 6.13,
and there is still no fix available. The code is also effectively dead,
well aside from triggering the warning, and runtime suspending the host
controller cannot even be tested with mainline yet (and this was
unfortunately not made clear in the commit message).

The change should have been part of a series that actually enabled the
functionality and not just a potential piece of it which cannot yet be
tested. Also, for Qualcomm controllers, we don't even yet have proper
suspend so it's probably not a good idea to throw runtime PM into the
mix there just yet.

But, sure, a revert would have made more sense last week. I guess you
have a few more weeks to address this now. We can always backport a
revert once rc1 is out.

Johan
