IIUC, this means that if one sets unboost to policy A, another core in
policy B (but sharing the same VR with core in policy A) will not be able
to achieve boost freq too. Then if policy A goes exit, the core in policy B
will get back to boost freq (without patch 1). And then core in B will be
unboosted again after core in A goes online/resume (because of patch 2).
But in the entire process, the boost flag in policy B is always enabled.

Please tell me I misunderstood because it looks really weird.ðŸ˜¥
