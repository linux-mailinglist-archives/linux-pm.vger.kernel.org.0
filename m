these drivers are not calling runtime_pm_enable in their drivers and
due to that it will not have any impact on these drivers.

irrespective of the controller runtime pm, we can enable host bridge
runtime pm. if the controller driver want to enable runtime pm they
need to make sure runtime pm is enabled before we enable the runtime
of the host bridge, otherwise it will not have any impact as they are
not even registering with runtime pm here.

ack, once above discussions gets concluded I will send a new patch
series with these details.
