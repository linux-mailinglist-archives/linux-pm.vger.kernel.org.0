It's possible there's something the core could do here.  It's
interesting that we have at least three issues in this area in this
release:

  1) This NVIDIA GPU issue
  2) Daniel's issue with AMD Ryzen5/7 XHCI power-on
     (https://lore.kernel.org/r/20191014061355.29072-1-drake@endlessm.com)
  3) Vidya's issue with Intel 750 NVMe power-on
     (https://lore.kernel.org/r/20191118172310.21373-1-vidyas@nvidia.com)

Vidya's current patch is the most generic (calling pci_dev_wait() from
pci_power_up()).  That will print a warning if the device doesn't
respond, but we still don't go as far as returning errors to
runtime_resume.

This is definitely something we should consider improving in the
future.

The lspci doesn't need to be after the failure occurs.  You can do it
immediately after boot.

If you can capture any part of the dmesg or console log of these
sudden shutdowns, that's all I'm interested in at this point.
