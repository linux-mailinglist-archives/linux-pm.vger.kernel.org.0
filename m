I would actually argue that this is also an implementation problem
rather than something fundamental about boosting. EAS could be taught
about iowait boosting and factor that into the decisions.

There's plenty of cases where EAS will correctly understand that
migrating a task away will not reduce the OPP (e.g. another task on the
rq has a uclamp_min request, or another CPU in the perf domain has a
higher request), so iowait boosting could probably be added.

In fact if the iowait boost was made a task property, EAS could easily
understand the effect of migrating that boost with the task (it's not
fundamentally different from migrating a task with a high uclamp_min
from the energy model perspective).

Sounds like another reason to make iowait boosting per-task to me :-)

I've always thought that turning iowait boosting into some sort of
in-kernel uclamp_min request would be a good approach for most of the
issues mentioned above. Note that I'm not necessarily saying to use the
actual uclamp infrastructure (though it's valid option), I'm really just
talking about the concept. Is that something you've considered?

I presume we could even factor out the 'logic' part of the code that
decides out to request the boost into its own thing, and possibly have
different policies for different use-cases, but that might be overkill.

Thanks,
Quentin
