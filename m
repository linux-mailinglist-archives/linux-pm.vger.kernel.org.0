As a proposal, maybe we can use the ACPI revision as an indicator for
whether ACPI implementation is new enough to not be affected by the old
problems. With the following simple patch runtime pm won't be disabled
per default for ACPI versions >= 6.0. AFAIK ACPI 6.0 was published in 2015.

On a side note:
It seems the sole motivation to disable runtime pm per default is ACPI
problems. So why do we disable runtime pm also on non-ACPI systems?
With the proposed patch runtime pm is enabled per default if
CONFIG_ACPI isn't defined.
