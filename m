For the record I did receive your original V3 cover letter from the
linux-mm mailing list.

Is the per swap slot entry overhead 24 bytes in your implementation?
The current swap overhead is 3 static +8 dynamic, your 24 dynamic is a
big jump. You can argue that 8->24 is not a big jump . But it is an
unnecessary price compared to the alternatives, which is 8 dynamic +
4(optional redirect).

My git log shows 7d0a66e4bb9081d75c82ec4957c50034cb0ea449 is tag "v6.18".

Ah, you need to mention that in the first line to Andrew. Spell out
this series is not for Andrew to consume in the MM series. It can't
any way because it does not apply to mm-unstable nor mm-stable.

BTW, I have the following compile error with this series (fedora 43).
Same config compile fine on v6.19.

Can you show your user space time as well to complete the picture?

How many runs do you have for stdev 32.8s?

I strongly suspect there is some performance difference that hasn't
been covered by your test yet. Need more conformation by others on the
performance measurement. The swap testing is tricky. You want to push
to stress barely within the OOM limit. Need more data.
