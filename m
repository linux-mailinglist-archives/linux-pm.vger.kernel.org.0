I do have a keen interest in this series, but mostly from the point of 
view of uclamp. Currently uclamp is able to send hint the scheduler to 
bias task placement. Some CPU cores are known to have very different 
energy efficiency depending on the task. We know these tasks beforehand 
and can use uclamp to bias to certain CPUs which we know are more 
efficient for them.

Personally I've always been wondering if this could just be reflected in 
the EM itself without emphasizing on the task placement aspect of 
uclamp. The idea of this series LGTM and I'll take a deeper look.
