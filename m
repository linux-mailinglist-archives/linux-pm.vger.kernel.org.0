Right.

This really depends on the ACPI methods involved, but as a rule (and
I'm not aware of any exceptions) the target power state of the device
for s2idle and "everything else" is the same.  If D3cold is possible,
it will be D3cold.  If not, that will be D3hot etc.

The only difference (from the individual device perspective) is that
in the ACPI S3 (or S4 if this matters here) case the platform firmware
(and that's not AML but something like SMM) may cut power off from it
later.

I'm not sure what you mean.  What states are supported or something else?

The standby, S2RAM and STD cases are actually different in that respect.

In the STD case we get the device from the restore kernel and it most
likely has been enumerated by it, so it is in whatever power state the
restore kernel puts it into.

For standby that most likely is the state in which the device was left
during suspend.

For S2RAM, it most likely will be something like D0-uninitialized,
because the platform firmware initiating the resume transition (which
is not AML, but again something like SMM) restores power to the
platform (including the majority of devices), but doesn't initialize
them as a rule.

The STD and S2RAM resume will undo the "magic", standby resume may not.

It is in whatever power state it was left in during suspend and we run
the same AML as in the other cases, modulo the possible power state
difference (with respect to the other cases).

This is correct.

Not really.

The problem is related to the fact that in s2idle the platform
firmware does not finalize the suspend transition and, consequently,
it doesn't initiate the resume transition.  Therefore whatever power
state the device was left in during suspend must be dealt with during
the subsequent resume.  Hence, if whatever is done by SXIO/SXFP/SXLF
in the suspend path cannot be reversed in the resume path by the
kernel (because there is no known method to do that), they should not
be invoked.  And that's exactly because the platform firmware will not
finalize the suspend transition which is indicated by
PM_SUSPEND_FLAG_FW_SUSPEND being unset.

Cheers!
