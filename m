Well, there is _STA that returns "off" initially, so the OS should set
the initial state of the device to D3cold and transition it into D0 as
appropriate (i.e. starting with setting all of the power resources
used by it to "on").

Well, that's inconsistent.

Also, it is rather pointless to update the device's power state at
this point, because nothing between this point and the later
do_pci_enable_device() call in this function requires its
current_state to be up to date AFAICS.

Have you tried to drop the power state update from
pci_enable_device_flags()?  [Note that we're talking about relatively
old code here and it looks like that code is not necessary any more.]

Either it should be possible to do that and all should work, or there
is a good reason to make current_state reflect the real current power
state of the device upfront, but then that should be done by putting
it into D0 diractly at that point rather than later.

Calling pci_power_up(dev) instead of pci_set_power_state(dev, PCI_D0)
when current_state is already 0 only pokes at the power resources,
because pci_raw_set_power_state() will do nothing then, but that is a
rather less-than-straightforward way of doing this.  Moreover, the
ordering of actions mandated by the spec is to set power resources to
"on" first and then write to the PMCSR, not the other way around.
