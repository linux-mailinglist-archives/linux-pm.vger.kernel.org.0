I also think that the USB controller might have some issue with .resume.
It is obvious that qcom-pcie RC doesn't implement suspend/resume which
means that its clocks are not disabled at the moment when USB is resuming.

Georgi, can you try to bypass suspend/resume in the USB driver itself?

Yes, definitely we did not implemented suspend/resume callbacks, but
that means that the RC should be functional while the system is in suspend.
