Subject: [PATCH v2 0/3] PCI: Add PCI_ERROR_RESPONSE, check for errors

Reads from a PCI device may fail if the device has been turned off (put
into D3cold), removed, or if some other error occurs.  The PCI host bridge
typically fabricates ~0 data to complete the CPU's read.

We check for that in a few places, but not in a consistent way.  This
series adds a PCI_ERROR_RESPONSE definition to make the checks more
consistent and easier to find.  Note that ~0 may indicate a PCI error, but
it may also be valid read data, so you need more information (such as
knowing that a register can never contain ~0) before concluding that it's
an error.

This series also adds a new check for PCI_ERROR_RESPONSE in the power
management code because that code frequently encounters devices in D3cold,
where we previously misinterpreted ~0 data.  It also uses pci_power_name()
to print D-state names more consistently.

Rafael, I didn't add your Reviewed-by to "PCI / PM: Return error when
changing power state from D3cold" because I made small changes to try to
make the messages more consistent, and I didn't want to presume they'd be
OK with you.

Changes since v1:
  - Add Rafael's Reviewed-By to the first two patches
  - Drop "PCI / PM: Check for error when reading PME status" because Rafael
    pointed out that some devices can signal PME even when in D3cold, so
    this would require additional rework
  - Drop "PCI / PM: Check for error when reading Power State" because
    Rafael thinks it's mostly redundant

Bjorn Helgaas (3):
  PCI: Add PCI_ERROR_RESPONSE definition
  PCI / PM: Decode D3cold power state correctly
  PCI / PM: Return error when changing power state from D3cold
