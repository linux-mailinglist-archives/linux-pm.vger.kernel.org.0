IMO putting a device to low power also qualifies as "quiesce the device".

For ACPI based system, there are .suspend for S3/s2idle, .poweroff for
S4, and .shutdown for S5.
Unless we want to introduce a new callback for S5, I think the concept
is quite similar.

For DT based system, the OS should also perform the same thing, as
there's no firmware to cleanup the power state.

We can also move .shutdown to be part of pm_ops, but I don't think
it's necessary,

Do you think adding a new "low power state" callback to be called
after .shutdown a good idea?
That would make the concept of .shutdown different to .suspend and
.poweroff. I personally see .suspend, .poweroff and .shutdown the same
action but target different power states.
