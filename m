Before doing that..

.. we should really understand this better because CML-H PCH root ports
and Titan/Alpine Ridge downstream ports all support active link
reporting so instead of the 1000+100ms you should see something like
this:

  1. Wait for the link + 100ms for the root port
  2. Wait for the link + 100ms for the Titan Ridge downstream ports
    (these are run paraller wrt all Titan Ridge downstream ports that have
     something connected)

If there is a TBT device connected then 2. is repeated for it and so on.

So the 1000ms+ is really unexpected. Are you running mainline kernel and
if so, can you share dmesg with CONFIG_PCI_DEBUG=y so we can see the
delays there? Maybe also add some debugging to
pcie_wait_for_link_delay() where it checks for the
!pdev->link_active_reporting and waits for 1100ms.
