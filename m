Right.

You say that some sort of power/ balanced power / balanced /
balanced performance / performance setting in is already exported
through the powercap interface today (if I understand you correctly)?

But I'm not seeing any such setting in:
Documentation/ABI/testing/sysfs-class-powercap

Nor can I find it under /sys/class/powercap/intel-rapl* on a ThinkPad
X1 carbon 8th gen.

Note, if there indeed is an existing userspace API for this I would
greatly prefer for the thinkpad_acpi and hp-wmi (and possibly other)
drivers to use this, so if you can point me to this interface then
that would be great.

Interesting the same thing was brought up in the discussion surrounding
RFC which I posted.

The downside against this approach is that it assumes that there
only is a single system-wide settings. AFAIK that is not always
the case, e.g. (AFAIK):

1. The intel pstate driver has something like this
    (might this be the rapl setting you mean? )

2. The X1C8 has such a setting for the embedded-controller, controlled
    through the ACPI interfaces which thinkpad-acpi used

3. The hp-wmi interface allows selecting a profile which in turn
    (through AML code) sets a bunch of variables which influence how
    the (dynamic, through mjg59's patches) DPTF code controls various
    things

At least the pstate setting and the vendor specific settings can
co-exist. Also the powercap API has a notion of zones, I can see the
same thing here, with a desktop e.g. having separate performance-profile
selection for the CPU and a discrete GPU.

So limiting the API to a single /sys/power/profile setting seems a
bit limited and I have the feeling we will regret making this
choice in the future.

With that said your proposal would work well for the current
thinkpad_acpi / hp-wmi cases, so I'm not 100% against it.

This would require adding some internal API to the code which
owns the /sys/power root-dir to allow registering a profile
provider I guess. But that would also immediately bring the
question, what if multiple drivers try to register themselves
as /sys/power/profile provider ?

Regards,

Hans
