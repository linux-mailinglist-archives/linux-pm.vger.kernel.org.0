The problem is already rooted into the function name, when a function is=20
called "forbid", anyone unfamiliar will think it really forbids=20
something. The docs just further reinforced the idea and the fact that it=
=20
also increments usage count.

It is quite unexpected and feels quite illogical (for non-PM person like=20
me) that user interface then goes to reverse that usage count increase,=20
what would be the logical reason why there now are less users for it when=
=20
user wants to turn on PM? (I understand things are done that way, no need=
=20
to explain that further, but there are quite a few misleading things in=20
this entire scenario, not just that parenthesis part of the docs.)

My personal approach is that if something comes up during review, it=20
likely is something also the next person to look at this change (from=20
history, maybe years from now) could similarly stumbles on when trying to=
=20
understand the change. Thus, it often is worth to mention such things in=20
the changelog too.

While I'm definitely not against improvements to docs too, the changelog=20
for any patch should help to understand why the change was made. And=20
IMO, this unexpected "internal detail" related to usage count which is=20
quite significant here, if user interface wouldn't lower it, runtime PM=20
would remain forbidden as forbid() promised.
