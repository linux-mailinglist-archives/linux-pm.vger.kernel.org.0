Well, I'm kind of unaware of this requirement.

It clearly is not even followed by the code without the $subject patch.

The real requirement is that the runtime PM status at the point when
runtime PM is re-enabled, that is in device_resume_early(), must
reflect the current actual HW state.

Drivers that only support runtime PM are broken with respect to system
sleep ATM.  They need to be made to support system sleep or they
cannot be used on systems that use system sleep.  There may be a way
around this for system suspend/resume (see below), but not for
hibernation.

Yes, and that's what I'm going to do.

> That said, it seems like we need another way forward.

I still don't see why, sorry.

I guess the concern is that if a device suddenly needs to be resumed
during system resume even though it was runtime-suspended before the
preceding system suspend, there is no way to tell its driver/bus
type/etc that this is the case if they all decide to leave the device
as is, but as I have said for multiple times in this thread, leaving a
device as is during system resume may not be an option unless it is a
leaf device without any subordinates.  This has always been the case.

We'll see if there is any damage resulting from the $subject change
and we'll fix it if so.

In the future, though, I'd like to integrate system resume with
runtime PM more than it is now.  Namely, it should be possible to move
the re-enabling of runtime PM to the front of device_resume_early()
and then use pm_runtime_resume() for resuming devices whose drivers
support runtime PM (I don't see any fundamental obstacles to this).
One benefit of doing this would be that pm_runtime_resume() would
automatically trigger a runtime resume for all of the "superior"
devices, so they could be left in whatever state they had been in
before the preceding system suspend regardless of what happens to
their "subordinates".  It is likely that some kind of driver opt-in
will be needed for this or maybe the core can figure it out by itself.

It can look at what callbacks are implemented etc.  For example, if a
driver only implements :runtime_suspend() and :runtime_resume() and no
other PM callbacks, it is reasonable to assume that the devices
handled by it should be suspended and resumed with the help of the
runtime PM infrastructure even during system-wide suspend/resume (that
doesn't apply to hibernation, though).
