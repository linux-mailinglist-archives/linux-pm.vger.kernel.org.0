Applied to for-linus with tweaks as below.  It's awfully late (my
fault for not pushing on this earlier) but I hope to squeeze it into
v5.18.

commit c1d27b79a94f ("PCI/ACPI: Allow D3 only if Root Port can signal and wake from D3")
Author: Mario Limonciello <mario.limonciello@amd.com>
Date:   Thu Mar 31 22:40:03 2022 -0500

    PCI/ACPI: Allow D3 only if Root Port can signal and wake from D3
    
    acpi_pci_bridge_d3(dev) returns "true" if "dev" is a hotplug bridge that
    can handle hotplug events while in D3.  Previously this meant either:
    
      - "dev" has a _PS0 or _PR0 method (acpi_pci_power_manageable()), or
    
      - The Root Port above "dev" has a _DSD with a "HotPlugSupportInD3"
        property with value 1.
    
    This did not consider _PRW, which tells us about wakeup GPEs (ACPI v6.4,
    sec 7.3.13).  Without a wakeup GPE, from an ACPI perspective the Root Port
    has no way of generating wakeup signals, so hotplug events will be lost if
    we use D3.
    
    Similarly, it did not consider _S0W, which tells us the deepest D-state
    from which a device can wake itself (sec 7.3.20).  If _S0W tells us the
    device cannot wake from D3, hotplug events will again be lost if we use D3.
    
    Some platforms, e.g., AMD Yellow Carp, supply "HotPlugSupportInD3" without
    _PRW or with an _S0W that says the Root Port cannot wake from D3.  On those
    platforms, we previously put bridges in D3hot, hotplug events were lost,
    and hotplugged devices would not be recognized without manually rescanning.
    
    Allow bridges to be put in D3 only if the Root Port can generate wakeup
    GPEs (wakeup.flags.valid), it can wake from D3 (_S0W), AND it has the
    "HotPlugSupportInD3" property.
    
    Neither Windows 10 nor Windows 11 puts the bridge in D3 when the firmware
    is configured this way, and this change aligns the handling of the
    situation to be the same.
