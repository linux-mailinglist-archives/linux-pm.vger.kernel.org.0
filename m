Both VMD and the non-ACPI host bridge controllers are mostly same functionality
wise, so I don't think the 'synthetic_domain' property makes sense.

IMO, it is better to go with the API introduced in this patch for VMD as it
clearly tells us the host bridge driver is overriding for a purpose and I can
set PCIE_LINK_STATE_ALL for DT based platforms separately.
