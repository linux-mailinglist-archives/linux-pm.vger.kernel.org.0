Hi Kairui,

Thank you so much for the performance test.

I will only comment on the performance number in this sub email thread.

Agree. That has been my main complaint about VS is the per swap entry
metadata overhead. This VS series reverted the swap table, but memory
and CPU performance is worse than swap table.

Whole series is too much zswap centric and punishes other swaps.

Now that is a deal breaker for me. Not the similar performance with
baseline or swap table P3.

At 4-8% I would consider it a statically significant performance
regression to favor swap table implementations.

Agree. That matches my view, get the fundamental infrastructure for
swap right first (swap table), then do those fancier feature
enhancement like online growing the size of swapfile.
