Certainly.

However, it does not make sense because dtpm is not a device and I don't
see a device returning EPROBE_DEFER right now.

Wanting to handle EPROBE_DEFER will make the code a gaz factory:
 - shall we destroy the hierarchy each time a device is returning a
EPROBE_DEFER ?
     * yes : then we need to recreate it every time we recall it and we
end with an empty tree in case of error
     * no : we have to keep track of what was created or not, in order
to attach the newly device to the tree with a the parent, etc ...

So an incredible complexity for actually having no device returning
EPROBE_DEFER.

In addition, let's imagine one of the component like cpufreq is a
module, no EPROBE_DEFER handling will prevent the description being
created before the cpufreq driver is loaded.

But... I agree the hierarchy creation function should be called after
all the devices were created. For that, I think the kernel is providing
what is needed:

1. We compile the SoC specific dtpm always as a module

	depends on ... && m

2. In the module we add the dependencies to other modules

	MODULE_SOFTDEP(post: panfrost)

And with that, all dependencies are explicitly described and the
hierarchy creation is safe.

Does it make sense ?
