First of all, there is a kerneldoc comment next to
pm_suspend_via_firmware() which is relevant.  Especially the last
paragraph of that comment applies directly to the case at hand IMV.

Next, if you see how pm_suspend_global_flags get populated, you'll
notice that pm_suspend_clear_flags() is called early in both the
system-wide suspend and hibernation paths and then the ACPI platform
callbacks invoke pm_set_suspend_via_firmware() when the platform is
going to finalize the suspend transition.  [In particular, notice the
acpi_state > ACPI_STATE_S1 condition in acpi_suspend_begin(), which is
related to the difference between ACPI S3/S4 and standby that I was
talking about before.]  This means that, on a system with ACPI,
PM_SUSPEND_FLAG_FW_SUSPEND is set only if the target system state is
above S1 and in those cases the firmware finalizes the suspend
transition.

Of course, s2idle callbacks don't invoke pm_set_suspend_via_firmware()
at all, because the target ACPI system state for s2idle is S0 (the
working state from the ACPI perspective).

Well, if you don't trust kerneldoc comments, you get to figure out
things yourself which may not be straightforward ...
