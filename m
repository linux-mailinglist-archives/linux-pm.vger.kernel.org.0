BMC is a great example here, yes. But not limited to it.

BMC is responsible of thermal control of not only host though,
but the entire server thermal, considering not only
host temperature sensor as inputs, but plenty of other sensing
in the motherboard, for instance.

The changes are not limited to BMC controlling a host temperature though.
Any system controlling a target device temperature will fit.

Yeah, I understand the typical BMC design would have its control
in userland. But as I said this not necessarily only about BMCs
controlling host temperature.

Primary reason to have in kernel is reliability compared to a
userspace based control, avoiding downtime of the control,
having the control available and stable during the entire
life time of the controlling system, e.g from
early boot, and avoiding unnecessary down time of the control
due to application crashes. Sure the kernel can crash too :-),
that is why this patch was written in the first place, but
it is a more rare case.

Userspace may still be involved here where user wants to have,
for example a fixed override cooling state. But in that case
the user would need to disable the in kernel control and
take care of the cooling state and corner scenarios, like
crash and reboot.

I also do not see anything that would prevent a control
of the controlling system, like a BMC, be put in the kernel,
given all the abstractions needed, cooling devices, governor,
sensors, are available there. Mechanically and physically
the thermal zone is still something part of the hardware
where the controlling system, say a BMC, is responsible for.
