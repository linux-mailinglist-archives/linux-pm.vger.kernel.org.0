To follow up on this discussion:
We could call pm_runtime_forbid() conditionally, e.g. with the following
condition. This would enable runtime pm per default for all non-ACPI
systems, and it uses the BIOS date as an indicator for a hopefully
not that broken ACPI implementation. However I could understand the
argument that this looks a little hacky ..

if (IS_ENABLED(CONFIG_ACPI) && dmi_get_bios_year() <= 2016)
