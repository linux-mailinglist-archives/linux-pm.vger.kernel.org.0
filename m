Right, it's obviously wrong in the case of devices that advertise
D3cold in PME_Support, i.e., devices that can generate PME even with
main power off.  Also, we may want to try to wake up devices if the
config read fails for a reason other than the device being in D3cold.

What I don't like about the current code is that it checks
PCI_PM_CTRL_PME_STATUS in data that may be completely bogus.  Do you
think it would be better to do something like this:

  pci_read_config_word(dev, pmcsr_pos, &pmcsr);
  if (pmcsr == (u16) PCI_ERROR_RESPONSE) {
    if (pci_pme_capable(dev, PCI_PM_CAP_PME_D3cold))
      return true;
    return false;
  }

or maybe this:

  pci_read_config_word(dev, pmcsr_pos, &pmcsr);
  if (pmcsr == (u16) PCI_ERROR_RESPONSE)
    return true;

We should get PCI_ERROR_RESPONSE pretty reliably from devices in
D3cold, so the first possibility would cover that case.

But since pci_check_pme_status() basically returns a hint ("true"
means a device *may* have generated a PME), and even if the hint is
wrong, the worst that happens is an unnecessary wakeup, maybe the
second possibility is safer.

What do you think?
