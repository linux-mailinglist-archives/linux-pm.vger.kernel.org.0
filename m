Subject: [PATCH] dt-bindings: devfreq: rk3399_dmc: Add rockchip,pmu phandle

The Rockchip DMC (Dynamic Memory Interface) needs to access to the PMU
general register files to know the DRAM type, so add a phandle to the
syscon that manages these registers.

Following the discussion in [1] and after having [2] accepted, this
patch is a RESEND of a patch [3] that has already all the acks but for
some reason and my bad, I lost the tracking, didn't land. The patch adds
documentation for an already property implemented in the driver, so
resend the patch again. There is a slighty modification, the rockchip,pmu
property has been moved to be optional as is not really required.

Thanks,
  Enric
