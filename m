Yes. Going in that direction, this patch from Vincent should help balancing
the load in your case I think. The patch evaluates other factors when the energy
cost of multiple CPU-candidates is the same.

Meaning, if all CPUs of the same type have only one OPP, the number of tasks
and the the load of the CPUs is then compared. This is not the case currently.
Doing so will help to avoid having one CPU close to being overutilized while
others are idle.

However I think it would still be better to have multiple OPPs in the energy model.
Indeed, it would be closer to reality as I assume that for Intel aswell, there
might be frequency domains and the frequency of the domain is lead by the most
utilized CPU.
This would also avoid hitting corner cases. As if there is one big task and many
small tasks, balancing on the number of tasks per CPU is not the best idea.
