Whether or not the other bits in the register make sense doesn't
matter here.  Only the PME_STATUS bit matters.

In this case it still would be prudent to check PME_ENABLE before
returning true and so there is no practical difference between
ERROR_RESPONSE and the valid data with PME_STATUS set.

Except that in the ERROR_RESPONSE case we may as well avoid the
PMCSR write which is not going to make a difference.

So if you really want to avoid the PMCSR write in the ERROR_RESPONSE case,
something like this can be done IMO:

 			return false;
 
 	/* Clear PME status. */
-	pmcsr |= PCI_PM_CTRL_PME_STATUS;
 	if (pmcsr & PCI_PM_CTRL_PME_ENABLE) {
+		if (pmcsr == (u16) PCI_ERROR_RESPONSE)
+			return true;
+
 		/* Disable PME to avoid interrupt flood. */
 		pmcsr &= ~PCI_PM_CTRL_PME_ENABLE;
 		ret = true;
