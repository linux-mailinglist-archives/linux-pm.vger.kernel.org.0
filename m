Let's reword this to use the positive sense, e.g., something like
"enable runtime power management for non-ACPI and ACPI 5.0 and newer."

This feels like a potentially significant change that could cause
breakage.  

  - How would a user recognize that we're doing something different?
    Maybe we need a note in dmesg?

  - If a system broke because of this, what would it look like?  How
    would a user notice a problem, and how would he or she connect the
    problem to this change?

  - Is there a kernel parameter that will get the previous behavior of
    disabling runtime PM as a workaround until a quirk can be added?
    If so, we should probably mention it here.  If not, should there
    be?

Please use an https://lore.kernel.org/r/... link instead.

Let's mention bb910a7040e9 ("PCI/PM Runtime: Make runtime PM of PCI
devices inactive by default") as well to help connect the dots here.
