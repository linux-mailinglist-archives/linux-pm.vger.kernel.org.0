Let's think of what cases we needed.

The "classic" suspend in the nvme driver basically shuts down the
device entirely.  This is useful for:

 a) device that have no power management
 b) System power states that eventually power off the entire PCIe bus.
    I think that would:

     - suspend to disk (hibernate)
     - classic suspend to ram

The we have the sequence in your patch.  This seems to be related to
some of the MS wording, but I'm not sure what for example tearing down
the queues buys us.  Can you explain a bit more where those bits
make a difference?

Otherwise I think we should use a "no-op" suspend, just leaving the
power management to the device, or a simple setting the device to the
deepest power state for everything else, where everything else is
suspend, or suspend to idle.

And of course than we have windows modern standby actually mandating
runtime D3 in some case, and vague handwaving mentions of this being
forced on the platforms, which I'm not entirely sure how they fit
into the above picture.
