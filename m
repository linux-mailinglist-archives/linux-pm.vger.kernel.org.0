I'd really like to figure out what "too early" means.  We can make it
later by enabling L1SS somewhere else, but unless we know exactly what
needs to happen first, we're likely to break it again.  And if we know
what's required, we can probably figure out a cleaner way to restore
it.

This is from 41cd766b0659 ("PCI: Don't enable aspm before drivers have
had a chance to veto it") [3].  I assume the idea is that driver probe
methods can use pci_disable_link_state() to veto certain link states.

I think this would be better as a quirk instead of a driver probe
method because I don't think ASPM really has anything to do with the
driver probe.  We do most ASPM configuration at enumeration (before
driver probe), so now we have this exception that we delay it until
probe time if the policy is POLICY_POWERSAVE or
POLICY_POWER_SUPERSAVE.

There are only about a dozen callers of pci_disable_link_state(), so
it doesn't seem impossible to change them to use quirks instead, e.g.,
quirk_disable_aspm_l0s() and quirk_disable_aspm_l0s_l1().
