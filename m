Sorry, my comments were unclear.  What I meant to say is that the
Thunderbolt runtime PM patches allow us to power the Thunderbolt
controller up or down from the OS and we can re-use that code in
the system-wide suspend code path if s2idle is used.

Without s2idle, power to the controller is cut by transitioning
to ACPI S3 or S4, which disables the controller's power rails
without OS involvement.

Thanks,

Lukas
