That one indeed remains unchanged.

Will add changes for Intel as well.

Right, my impression was that we want to leave that one as is.
Will add appropriate changes.

So just for my clarification we want a config switch to control what
scaling_cur_freq is to actually provide. It will keep the current behaviour as
default until we are ready to flip it and ultimately drop that temporary config
option ?

That one is already provided unless you have smth else on mind ?
Like updating scaling_cur_freq to reference the new sysfs attribute ?
