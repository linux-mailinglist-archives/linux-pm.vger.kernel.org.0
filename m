Right. Though I hope there's some middle ground. I mean all of those dev_err
in error paths of many drivers are there mostly to help debugging stuff.

And even though I was part of this driver's development, it took me quite
some time to figure out it was the missing sunxi-sid driver causing the issue,
with complete silence from the driver.

Maybe this can/will be solved at another level entirely, like having a device
core report devices probes that failed with EPROBE_DEFER some time after
the boot finished and modules had a chance to load, instead of immediately
for each probe retry.

regards,
	o.
