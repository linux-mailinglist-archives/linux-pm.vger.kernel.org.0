In some cases it isn't possible to have a nice unit, the Qualcomm modem
and DSPs expose a service for activating certain thermal mitigations
such as limiting the baseband power. This firmware interface was
designed *for* the cooling_device framework, as such the controls all
have arbitrary maximum states (1, 3, 5, 50, etc) that don't relate
directly to any unit.

Other cases like restricting the charging speed to improve thermal
headroom would actually fit into a generic framework quite well. You
just need to know the current "performance state", maximum state, and
some normalised cost/benefit of moving to a lower/higher state.

The power supply framework would then be able to say "hey you can limit
charging by this much without much impact, but going further will be
quite bad (as the device will start discharging)".

This also neatly describes the camera ISP and video transcoding
co-processors, they might be able to estimate their current performance
state so that userspace could then handle restricting them, and the
values could be used to inform the system at least.

Having the scheduler, userspace, and/or firmware be able to express
priorities for specific devices would then allow us to dynamically
adjust device performance based on the current usecase.

The classic example is limiting charging current when gaming, this is an
obvious choice over limiting CPU/GPU frequencies, a performance QoS
framework should allow us to make these choices with little/no input
from userspace.

In another case, we might be trying to maximise battery life, this could
impose some hard limits on the max performance of certain devices, and
when we are on charge maybe we want to give as much thermal headroom as
possible to the charger instead of other components.


Apologies if the signal/noise ratio is pretty rough here, I think in
general it would be nicer to try and have some fairly generic framework
rather than having a bunch of different ones with different units and
trying to tie them all together somehow.

Thanks and regards,
