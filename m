I applied the commits from pci/pm-2 to pci/pm (pci/pm-2 was really
just to get the 0-day robot to build test it).

pci/pm is based on v5.4-rc1, which doesn't have 45144d42f299 ("PCI:
PM: Fix pci_power_up()"), which appeared in -rc4.

All my branches are based on -rc1.  I *could* rebase them all to -rc4,
but that's quite a bit of work and affects Lorenzo as well, so I'd
rather not.  What's the git expert's way of doing this?

I guess worst case I could rebase this series to apply on pci/pm
(-rc1-based), accept that Linus will see a conflict, and resolve it
during his merge.
