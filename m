I know that we can, the question is whether or not we should.

IOW, there needs to be at least some technical grounds on which to
assume that a given ACPI release is safe enough.

Admittedly, I don't have a list of them, so I would need to look them
up and not just in the mailing lists.

Also note that this change will allow PM-runtime to be used on PCI
devices without drivers by default and that may not be entirely safe
either.  It didn't work really well in the past IIRC, so I'm wondering
what's the reason to believe that it will work just fine this time.
