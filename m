Hi, I'm trying to understand how these flags are supposed to work.
What I'd like to do, is when my pcie device runtime suspends (d3cold),
I would like it to stay off during system suspend and resume and on be
turned on again if the user accesses the device which would cause it
to be runtime resumed.  Runtime pm works fine on the devices, but they
get resumed on system suspend and powered back up on system resume.
The driver provides the following pm callbacks:

static const struct dev_pm_ops amdgpu_pm_ops =3D {
        .suspend =3D amdgpu_pmops_suspend,
     .resume =3D amdgpu_pmops_resume,
    .freeze =3D amdgpu_pmops_freeze,
    .thaw =3D amdgpu_pmops_thaw,
        .poweroff =3D amdgpu_pmops_poweroff,
    .restore =3D amdgpu_pmops_restore,
        .runtime_suspend =3D amdgpu_pmops_runtime_suspend,
        .runtime_resume =3D amdgpu_pmops_runtime_resume,
        .runtime_idle =3D amdgpu_pmops_runtime_idle,
};

I'm having trouble parsing the last few paragraphs in the pm
documentation (https://www.kernel.org/doc/html/latest/driver-api/pm/devices=
.html).
Ideally once the device is runtime suspended, it would not be powered
up again until someone accesses the device and it runtime resumes with
possibly multiple system suspend/resume cycles in between.

"If that function returns true, the driver=E2=80=99s =E2=80=9Cnoirq=E2=80=
=9D and =E2=80=9Cearly=E2=80=9D
resume callbacks should be skipped and the device=E2=80=99s runtime PM stat=
us
will be set to =E2=80=9Csuspended=E2=80=9D by the PM core. Otherwise, if th=
e device
was runtime-suspended during the preceding system-wide suspend
transition and its DPM_FLAG_SMART_SUSPEND is set, its runtime PM
status will be set to =E2=80=9Cactive=E2=80=9D by the PM core. [Hence, the =
drivers
that do not set DPM_FLAG_SMART_SUSPEND should not expect the runtime
PM status of their devices to be changed from =E2=80=9Csuspended=E2=80=9D t=
o =E2=80=9Cactive=E2=80=9D
by the PM core during system-wide resume-type transitions.]"

The last sentence is confusing me.  Why would setting
DPM_FLAG_SMART_SUSPEND change the status to active?  Wouldn't still be
suspended?

"Likewise, if DPM_FLAG_MAY_SKIP_RESUME is set for a device, its
driver=E2=80=99s system-wide =E2=80=9Cnoirq=E2=80=9D and =E2=80=9Cearly=E2=
=80=9D resume callbacks may be
skipped while its =E2=80=9Clate=E2=80=9D and =E2=80=9Cnoirq=E2=80=9D suspen=
d callbacks may have been
executed (in principle, regardless of whether or not
DPM_FLAG_SMART_SUSPEND is set). In that case, the driver needs to be
able to cope with the invocation of its ->runtime_resume callback
back-to-back with its =E2=80=9Clate=E2=80=9D and =E2=80=9Cnoirq=E2=80=9D su=
spend ones. [For instance,
that is not a concern if the driver sets both DPM_FLAG_SMART_SUSPEND
and DPM_FLAG_MAY_SKIP_RESUME and uses the same pair of suspend/resume
callback functions for runtime PM and system-wide suspend/resume.]"

The last sentence here is confusing me again.  I'm not following why
it matters if the callbacks are the same.  Why would the suspend and
resume callbacks be called at all.  Wouldn't it just be the runtime
variants?

It's not clear what happens with the suspend and resume pm callbacks.
The documentation only mentions the early/late and noirq callbacks.
Is the idea that the driver should not use the suspend/resume
callbacks in this case if they want to skip system suspend/resume in
favor of the runtime variant?

Thanks,

Alex
