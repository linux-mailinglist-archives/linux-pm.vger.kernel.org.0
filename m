No, that's not my point at all.  I don't really care whether the
interface is called pm_suspend_via_firmware() or is_s2idle().

What I don't like about this is that it's all just unexplained magic,
as was the original quirk.

IIUC, the quirk is applied by pci_pm_suspend_noirq() *after* it puts
the device in a low-power state.  Here's my uninformed speculation
about what happens:

  - On suspend, pci_pm_suspend_noirq() puts device in low-power state.
    My *guess* is this means D0 or D3hot for s2idle, and D3cold for
    everything else.  [Do we have sufficient debug to find out what
    these states are?]

  - pci_pm_suspend_noirq() does pci_fixup_suspend_late fixups,
    including quirk_apple_poweroff_thunderbolt().

  - quirk_apple_poweroff_thunderbolt() runs the magic SXIO/SXFP/SXLF
    methods, which apparently turn off more power.

  - On resume, pci_pm_resume_noirq() brings the device back to D0.

    If we're resuming from standby, S2RAM, or STD, I speculate the
    device is in D3cold, so this involves running AML that seems to
    undo whatever SXIO/SXFP/SXLF did.

    If we're resuming from s2idle, I speculate the device is in D0 or
    D3hot, and we run different AML (or maybe no AML at all), and we
    *don't* undo the effects of SXIO/SXFP/SXLF, so the device doesn't
    work.

If the above is anything like what's happening, we should be able to
skip SXIO/SXFP/SXLF based on the current power state of the device.
E.g., if the device is in D0 or D3hot, we should not use
SXIO/SXFP/SXLF to yank power.

That would seem more connected to the observable state of the device
than using pm_suspend_via_firmware(), which relies on the connection
between s2idle and PM_SUSPEND_FLAG_FW_SUSPEND (which is not at all
obvious) and the power state of the device while in s2idle (also not
obvious).
