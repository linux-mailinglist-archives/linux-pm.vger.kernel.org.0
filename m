IIUC, his setup/platform doesn't support any deeper idle states than the
shallowest WFI on all arm systems. I was about to ask if he has already
tried to build a cpuidle driver with just that WFI state or is he relying
on default arch_cpu_idle() which is one possible reason to take different
path and hence not executing the expected s2idle path.
