I don't see what you mean.  The !pci_device_is_present(dev) test tells
us something about what the state of the device was at some time in
the past, but of course it doesn't say anything about whether reading
PCI_PM_CTRL will succeed, e.g.,

  # dev is present and in D0
  platform_pci_get_power_state(dev) == PCI_D3cold   # currently false
  !pci_device_is_present(dev)                       # currently false
  # dev is surprise hot-removed or put in D3cold
  pci_read_config_word(PCI_PM_CTRL, &pmcsr)
  # pmcsr == ~0 (error response)

(Maybe going to D3cold is impossible, but it's pretty hard to prove
that.  The hot-remove is definitely possible.)

Definitely.  The point is not to prevent current_state from becoming
stale, it's to prevent us from interpreting ~0 data (known to be
invalid) as though it were a valid register value.
