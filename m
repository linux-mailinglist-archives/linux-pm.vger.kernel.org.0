Can you fill us in a little bit on the solution?  Are you referring to
an out-of-tree PLX kernel driver?  I assume this is not a userspace
PLX tool because I don't think we have a solution to make sysfs mmap
safe yet.

Did you have to call pm_runtime_get() or similar from your driver?
Did your driver already call some PM interface before that?  (If you
could point us at the source, that would be ideal.)

Rafael, does a PCI driver have to indicate somehow that it's prepared
for runtime PM?  I assume the runtime PM core is designed in such a
way that it doesn't force driver changes (e.g., maybe driver changes
would enable more power savings, but at least things would *work*
unchanged).
