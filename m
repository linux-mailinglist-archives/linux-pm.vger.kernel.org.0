Yes, gotcha. Why not be consistent 'in the other way' then?

Somewhat inaccurate meaning not making any prediction?
cpu_data->sleep_length_ns = KTIME_MAX;

How much is the harm for calling tick_nohz_get_sleep_length() when
polling anyway?
I know tick_nohz_get_sleep_length() is the majority of the usual
cpuidle entry path, but for many scenarios where state0 is appropriate
that should be pretty fast, no?

They do though.
commit 5ddcc03a07ae ("powerpc/cpuidle: Set CPUIDLE_FLAG_POLLING for snooze state")
So they have a polling 'snooze' and a relatively high latency (hundreds usecs)
non-polling state and no deeper state.
So if they don't query sleep length on snooze on a (1us)-interrupt-wakeup heavy
workload they will get 50% state0 and 50% state1 (because intercepts recovered
due to not querying sleep length).

I will.
