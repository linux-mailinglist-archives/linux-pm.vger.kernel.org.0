I tend to agree, but not completely.

The substantial difference between s2idle and S2RAM is that with the
latter control is passed to the platform firmware at the end of the
suspend transition, but that part of the platform firmware is SMM
rather than AML and so this has no bearing on whether or not power is
removed from the controller by any AML code.

That said, the platform firmware code completing the S2RAM suspend
transition does remove power from various system components which may
(and probably does) include the Thunderbolt controller.

IOW, the s2idle path needs to actively power manage the controller in
order to achieve desirable results, whereas in the S2RAM case that
isn't strictly necessary due to the fundamental difference between the
two variants of system-wide suspend.

Right.
