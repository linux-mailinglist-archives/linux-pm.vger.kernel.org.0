Yes, and if you do not count the Linaro contributions, there are even
less entries.

That may imply the sustainable power is estimated in most of the case if
the vendors are specifying the ipa governor. This series may change the
default behavior, but I guess this is not a problem without the right
k_* in any case.

Yes, sure. Let me review the patch 2/2.
