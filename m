Well, one problem is that the "old" (actually existing) I/F has made it
to one of my OSS EU presentation slides (I did not talk to this particular
slide, but it is there in the deck that's available for downloading), so who
knows who is going to use it. :-)

So I guess that there's a risk that needs to be taken into consideration.

What could be done, in principle, would be to make the new I/F depend on
CONFIG_PCIEASPM_DEBUG being unset and provide the "old" one when it is set.

In any case, the pcie_aspm.policy module parameter cannot be dropped, because
AFAICS there is quite a bit of user space using it (e.g. TLP).

Cheers!
