Is this true as pm_runtime_forbid() also increases PM usage count?

"void pm_runtime_forbid(struct device *dev);

unset the power.runtime_auto flag for the device and increase its 
usage counter (used by the /sys/devices/.../power/control interface to 
effectively prevent the device from being power managed at run time)"

Adding that pm_runtime_get_noresume() doesn't look useful given 
pm_runtime_forbid() already increases PM usage count. If this problem is 
actually seen in practice, there could a bug elsewhere where something 
decrements usage count too early so this change "helps" by double 
incrementing the usage count.

To find more information what's going on, one could try to trace events 
for the PM usage count (though last time I looked not all paths that 
change PM usage count were covered by the event and adding the 
trace_event() calls into the header turned out too much magic for me to 
figure out so I couldn't solve the problem).

I can see there could be other failure modes besides just saving wrong 
config if devices get suspended underneath the resource assignment 
algorithm.

Besides hotplug, also BAR resize does changes the resources and BARs.
This case is not helped by this patch.

I also recently learned some DT platforms do the "actual" scan for the bus 
later on Link Up event through irq which could perhaps occur late enough, 
I dunno for sure.

I'm also not entirely convinced these always pair or if the pci_dev may 
get removed before pci_bus_add_device(), see e.g., enable_slot() in 
hotplug/acpiphp_glue.c that does acpiphp_sanitize_bus() before 
pci_bus_add_devices() (which could have other bugs too as is).

Probably some tool will auto-insert the Cc: tags as receipients so it 
might be non-trivial to get rid of it.
