Yes, and I posted the fix patch right now:
  https://lore.kernel.org/r/20200422203744.26299-1-tiwai@suse.de

The possible cause was the tricky resume code that both HD-audio
controller (the parent PCI device) and the codec devices used.

At least the patch above seems working for the reporter's machine.
Now we need a bit more testing before merging, but it looks promising,
so far.
