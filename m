It could, if the device was left in D0 during suspend, but drivers
don't let devices stay in D0 during suspend as a rule, so this is all
academic, except for the NVMe driver that has just started to do it in
5.3-rc1.

It has started to do that becasuse of what can be regarded as a
hardware issue, but this does not even matter here.

By "standard PCI PM" I mean what pci_prepare_to_sleep() does. And yes,
in the vast majority of cases the device goes from D0 to D3hot then.

Yes, that can be considered as an NVMe erratum and the NVMe driver has
been *already* patched because of that in 5.3-rc1. [That's the commit
mentioned in the changelog of the $subject patch.]

It effectively asks the PCI bus type to leave *all* devices handled by
it in D0 during suspend-to-idle.  Already today.

I hope that this clarifies the current situation. :-)

For some devices that's what happens. For some other devices the state
of the link in D3hot appears to be L1 or L2/L3 Ready (as per the spec)
and that's when the $subject patch makes a difference.

The underlying principle is that the energy used by the system while
suspended depends on the states of all of the PCIe links and the
deeper the link state, the less energy the system will use.

Now, say an NVMe device works in accordance with the spec, so when it
goes from D0 to D3hot, its PCIe link goes into L1 or L2/L3 Ready.  As
of 5.3-rc1 or later it will be left in D0 during suspend-to-idle
(because that's how the NVMe driver works), so its link state will
depend on whether or not ASPM is enabled for it.  If ASPM is enabled
for it, the final state of its link will depend on how deep ASPM is
allowed to go, but if ASPM is not enabled for it, its link will remain
in L0.

This means, however, that by allowing that device to go into D3hot
when ASPM is not enabled for it, the energy used by the system while
suspended can be reduced, because the PCIe link of the device will
then go to L1 or L2/L3 Ready.  That's exactly what the $subject patch
does.

Is this still not convincing enough?
