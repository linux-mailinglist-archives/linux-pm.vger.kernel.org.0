We are describing the hardware. From the hardware point of view, there
is a PMU. I think at some point we would really like to describe all
Qualcomm/Atheros WiFI+BT units using this PMU approach, including the
older ath10k units present on RB3 (WCN3990) and db820c (QCA6174).

Is this target tied to the device or not? If not, this might become a
limitation, if somebody installs two WiFi/BT modules to a single
device.

This looks really nice, it will allow us to migrate the BT driver to
always use pwrseq instead of regulators without touching the DT.
