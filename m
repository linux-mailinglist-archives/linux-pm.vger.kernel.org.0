I was curious about what states we actually put this device in for
s2idle/standby/s2ram/std because I was hoping we could decide based
on what state s2idle used.  But if they all use the same target state,
that idea won't work.

How can we connect "if (!pm_suspend_via_firmware())" in this patch
with the fact that firmware doesn't finalize suspend (and consequently
does not reverse things in resume)?

I don't see any use of pm_suspend_via_firmware() or
PM_SUSPEND_FLAG_FW_SUSPEND that looks relevant.  That makes it really
hard to figure out how this patch works and how to avoid breaking it
in the future.

Thanks for your patience in explaining all this!
