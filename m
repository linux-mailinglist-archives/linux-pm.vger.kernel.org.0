This is really interesting -- did they discover a functional problem,
or did they just notice that we don't follow the PCI PM spec?

This do_pci_disable_device() proposal is interesting.

pci_enable_device() turns on PCI_COMMAND_MEMORY and PCI_COMMAND_IO,
which enables the device to respond to MMIO and I/O port accesses to
its BARs from the driver.  It also makes sure the device is in D0,
because BAR access only works in D0.

pci_set_master() turns on PCI_COMMAND_MASTER, which enables the device
to perform DMA (including generating MSIs).

pci_disable_device() *sounds* like it should be the opposite of
pci_enable_device(), but it's currently basically the same as
pci_clear_master(), which clears PCI_COMMAND_MASTER to prevent DMA.
I didn't know about this text in 8.2.2, and I wish I knew why we
don't currently clear PCI_COMMAND_MEMORY and PCI_COMMAND_IO.

If we want to pursue this, I think it should be split to its own patch
and moved out of pci_disable_device() because I don't think this path
necessary implies putting the device in D3, so I think it would fit
better with the spec if we cleared PCI_COMMAND_MEMORY and
PCI_COMMAND_IO in a path that explicitly does put it in D3.

I think there's a significant chance of breaking something because
drivers are currently able to access BARs after pci_disable_device(),
and there are a LOT of callers.  But if there's a problem it would
fix, we should definitely explore it.
