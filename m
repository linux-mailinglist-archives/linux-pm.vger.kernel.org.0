yep.. but we were trying to talk to Nvidia and Intel about it and had
no luck getting anything out of them so far. We gave up on Nvidia,
Intel is still pending.

correct

correct, but this seems to be fine and doesn't fix the issue if that
part is skipped

if the "link" is powered up again (via 0x248, 0xbc or 0xb0 on the GPU
bridge or the ACPI _ON method) the GPU comes up in the D0 state and is
fully operational, well besides the little issue we've got with the D3
write. It can also be worked around by putting the PCIe link into 5.0
and 8.0 mode, but that's not reliable enough as it fails it around 10%
of all tries.

When I was checking up on some of the PCI registers of the bridge
controller, the slot detection told me that there is no device
recognized anymore. I don't know which register it was anymore, though
I guess one could read it up in the SoC spec document by Intel.

My guess is, that the bridge controller fails to detect the GPU being
here or actively threw it of the bus or something. But a normal system
suspend/resume cycle brings the GPU back online (doing a rescan via
sysfs gets the device detected again)

okay, if you think this is the preferred way then I can change the
patch accordingly.
