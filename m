This doesn't look right.  The refcount underflow issue seems new,
we surely haven't been doing the wrong thing since 2012.

local_pci_probe() increases the refcount to keep the device in D0.
If the driver wants to use runtime suspend, it needs to decrement
the refcount on ->probe() and re-increment on ->remove().

In the dmesg output attached to...

https://bugzilla.kernel.org/show_bug.cgi?id=220216

... the device exhibiting the refcount underflow is a PCIe port.
Are you also seeing this on a PCIe port or is it a different device?

So the refcount decrement happens in pcie_portdrv_probe() and
the refcount increment happens in pcie_portdrv_remove().
Both times it's conditional on pci_bridge_d3_possible().
Does that return a different value on probe versus remove?

Does any of the port service drivers decrement the refcount
once too often?  I've just looked through pciehp but cannot
find anything out of the ordinary.

Looking through recent changes, 002bf2fbc00e and bca84a7b93fd
look like potential candidates causing a regression, but the
former is for AER (which isn't used in the dmesg attached to
the bugzilla) and the latter touches suspend on system sleep,
not runtime suspend.

Can you maybe instrument the pm_runtime_{get,put}*() functions
with a printk() and/or dump_stack() to see where a gratuitous
refcount decrement occurs?

Alternatively, is there a known-good kernel version which does
not exhibit the issue and which could serve as anchor for
git bisect?

Thanks,

Lukas
