It's not a matter of being convincing, it's a matter of dissecting and
analyzing this far enough so it makes sense to someone who hasn't
debugged the problem.  Since we're talking about ASPM being enabled,
that really means making the connections to specific PCIe situations.

I'm not the nvme maintainer, so my only interest in this is that it
was really hard for me to figure out how pcie_aspm_enabled() is
related to pm_suspend_via_firmware() and ctrl->npss.

But I think it has finally percolated through.  Here's my
understanding; see it has any connection with reality:

  Prior to d916b1be94b6 ("nvme-pci: use host managed power state for
  suspend"), suspend always put the NVMe device in D3hot.

  After d916b1be94b6, when it's possible, suspend keeps the NVMe
  device in D0 and uses NVMe-specific power settings because it's
  faster to change those than to do D0 -> D3hot -> D0 transitions.

  When it's not possible (either the device doesn't support
  NVMe-specific power settings or platform firmware has to be
  involved), we use D3hot as before.

  So now we have these three cases for suspending an NVMe device:

    1  D0 + no ASPM + NVMe power setting
    2  D0 +    ASPM + NVMe power setting
    3  D3hot

  Prior to d916b1be94b6, we always used case 3.  After d916b1be94b6,
  we used case 1 or 2 whenever possible (we didn't know which).  Case
  2 seemed acceptable, but the power consumption in case 1 was too
  high.

  This patch ("nvme-pci: Allow PCI bus-level PM to be used if ASPM is
  disabled") would replace case 1 with case 3 to reduce power
  consumption.

AFAICT we don't have a way to compute the relative power consumption
of these cases.  It's possible that even case 2 would use more power
than case 3.  You can empirically determine that this patch makes the
right trade-offs for the controllers you care about, but I don't think
it's clear that this will *always* be the case, so in that sense I
think pcie_aspm_enabled() is being used as part of a heuristic.
