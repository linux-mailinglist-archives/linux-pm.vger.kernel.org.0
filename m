Hi Lukasz,

sorry for the delay, it took more time to finish my current work before
commenting these patches.

It is unclear if we are talking about frequency limit of the dvfs device
by setting the hardware limit (min-max freq). If it is the case, then
that is an energy model change, and all user of the energy model must be
notified about this change. But I don't see why userspace wants to
change that.

If we just want to set a frequency limit, then that is what we are doing
with the DTPM framework via power numbers.

That is because the IPA introduced the power rebalancing between devices
belonging the same thermal zone, so the feature was very use case specific.

The DTPM is supposed to solve this by providing an unified uW unit to
act on the different power capable devices on a generic way.

Today DTPM is mapped to userspace using the powercap framework, but it
is considered to add kernel API to let other subsystem to act on it
directly. May be, you can add those and call them from IPA directly, so
the governor does power decision and ask the DTPM to do the changes.

Conceptually, that would be much more consistent and will remove
duplicated code IMO.

May be create a power_qos framework to unify the units ...

Sounds like the DTPM is doing exactly that, no ?

We are talking about power, frequency, in-kernel governor, userspace
having knowledge of max frequency limit to set power.

I'm a bit lost. What is the problem we want to solve here ?

May be I'm missing something. Is it possible to share a scenario where
the userspace acts on the devfreq and the IPA taking decision to
illustrate your proposal ?
