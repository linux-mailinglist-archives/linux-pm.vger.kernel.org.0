It is called in two places, pci_power_up() and pci_set_power_state().

pci_power_up() is called on resume when the whole hierarchy is
turned on and pci_set_power_state() explicitly powers up the
device if in D3cold (with the help of the platform).

And the "device not accessible at all" case should be covered by patch [2/5]
in this series.

I guess you mean surprise-hot-removed?

Then it may as well be hot-removed after setting current_state.

Well, D3cold may just be equally misleading, because the device may
very well not be present at all any more.

Not exactly.

I mean "if (platform_pci_get_power_state(dev) == PCI_D3cold ||
!pci_device_is_present(dev))".

Surprise hot-removal can take place at any time, in particular after setting
current_state, so adding extra checks here doesn't prevent the value of
it from becoming stale at least sometimes anyway.

IMO this means more complex code and extra overhead for a very
little practical value, however.
