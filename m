Is the issue perhaps that this is now gated on both correctable and 
uncorrectable errors?

Perhaps should *correctable errors* be emitted with a warning and the 
*uncorrectable errors* be fatal?

 From the driver perspective it does have expectations that the parts 
outside the driver did the right thing.  If the driver was expecting the 
root port to be powered down at suspend and it wasn't there are hardware 
components that didn't power cycle and that's what we're seeing here.
