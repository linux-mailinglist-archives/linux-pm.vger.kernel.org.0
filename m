Actually, it needs to fail if PME cannot be signaled from the target
state and the device is not power-manageable by the platform.

A better idea may be to make pci_pme_capable() also check if the
parent bridge can go into D3cold and return "true" if so and "state"
is D3hot while PME signaling from D3cold is supported.
