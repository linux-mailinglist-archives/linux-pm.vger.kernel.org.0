Well, there are two things here.

First, there were systems in which ACPI PM was not ready for changing
power states in the S0 system state (ie. run-time) and it was assuming
that power states would only be changed during transitions to sleep
states (S1 - S4) and to S5.  This can be covered by the ACPI revicion
check, but I'm not sure if ACPI 5.0 is the right one.  Why ACPI 5 and
not ACPI 6, for instance?

Second, there were PCI devices without ACPI PM where the PCI standard
PM didn't work correctly.  This is not related to ACPI at all and I'm
not sure why the ACPI revision check would be sufficient to cover
these cases.
