To clarify a bit - what Kairui's proposal gives us (IIUC) is a dynamic
clustered approach on swap slot allocation. It's already done at the
physical level.

This is precisely what this RFC is missing. So if there is a way to
combine the work, I think it will go a long way in reducing the
regression.

That said, I haven't looked closely at his code yet, so I don't know
how easy/hard it is to combine the efforts :)
