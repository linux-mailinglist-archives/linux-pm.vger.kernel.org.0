The subject convention in drivers/pci would be "PCI/ACPI:"

But more importantly, please turn the subject from a non-specific
negative ("Don't blindly trust") into a more specific *positive*,
e.g.,

  PCI/ACPI: Assume HotPlugSupportInD3 only if device can wake from D3

Thanks for the Microsoft URL.  To make this commit log self-contained
and guard against the link becoming stale, can you quote the relevant
text here, since it's not long:

  This ACPI object [HotPlugSupportInD3] enables the operating system
  to identify and power manage PCIe Root Ports that are capable of
  handling hot plug events while in D3 state.

Please include the spec reference (ACPI v6.4, sec 7.3.20) in case the
URL below becomes stale, and again, the relevant text is barely longer
than the URL and could be included:

  7.3.20 _S0W (S0 Device Wake State)

  This object evaluates to an integer that conveys to OSPM the deepest
  D-state supported by this device in the S0 system sleeping state
  where the device can wake itself.

I guess the argument is that we can put a Root Port into D3 only if
_S0W indicates that it can wake from D3 *and* it has the
HotPlugSupportInD3 property?

I'm naive about ACPI sleep/wake, but that does sound plausible.

But the patch doesn't say anything about _S0W, so we need to somehow
connect the dots there.

acpi_pci_bridge_d3()

Would be good to say what "these situations" are.  I guess this fixes
a bug, so let's outline what that bug is, what the symptoms are, who
reported and tested it, etc.

s/changes/change/

Sentence also needs a little polishing: "aligns ... both do as well"
doesn't quite flow.

Does this make things work like Windows 10/11 from a user's point of
view, or have you somehow confirmed that Windows actually checks _S0W
and HotPlugSupportInD3 in the same way?
