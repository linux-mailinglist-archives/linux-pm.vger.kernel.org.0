pci_pm_runtime_suspend() calls pci_finish_runtime_suspend(), which
enables wake-up, unless "pci_dev->state_saved".  IIUC we should be
enabling wake-up unless the driver has called pci_save_state() itself.

So I infer that your driver does call pci_save_state() and the PCI
core does not enable wake-up.  Right?

Why does your driver call pci_save_state()?  In most cases I don't
think drivers should need to do that themselves because the PCI core
will do it for them.  E.g., see Vaibhav's recent eb6779d4c505 ("e1000:
use generic power management") [1]
