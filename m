I have zero confidence that we understand the real problem, but we do
need to do something with this.  I'll merge it for v5.5 if we get the
minor procedural stuff below straightened out.

A device in D3cold is off the bus by definition.

IIUC the problem is that the sequence D0 -> D3hot -> D3cold -> D0 for
the GPU fails in the transition back to D0, while D0 -> D3cold -> D0
works fine.

So I guess the problem is that we can put the device in D3cold with no
problem, but if we put in D3hot before going to D3cold, the device
never comes back to D0.  Right?

Actually, I think there's only one underlying issue with several

s/pci/PCI/

More details about these crashes would be useful as we look at places
that *should* be able to handle errors like this.

This doesn't fit with the others and more details might be
informative here as well.

All these register addresses are device-specific, so they're useless
without identifying the device.  "lspci -vvnn" output would let us at
least connect this with something.  It would be nice to have that info
archived along with your acpidump and python repro scripts in a
bugzilla with the URL in the commit log.

These are likely in PCI capabilities.  If I make the leap of assuming
the "link disable" bit is PCI_EXP_LNKCTL_LD, that would mean the Link
Control register is at 0xb0 and the register at 0xbc would be the Root
Control register, and indeed 0x20 in Root Control is reserved.

I don't know what the relevance of all this is, though.  It's not
remarkable that accesses to these registers work.

Unless you mean you can access these registers *after* trying to put
the device back in D0, but other accesses to the device fail.  That
would indeed be very interesting.

I don't think we can conclude anything about where the defect is and I
don't think speculating here will help future readers of this code.

I *would* still like to see a bugzilla listing the systems where this
problem has been seen with the "lspci -vvnn", dmesg logs, and at least
one acpidump.  I think there's more to this story, and I suspect we
may be revisiting this in the future.

pci_upstream_bridge() may return NULL, so you need

  if (bridge && bridge->vendor == PCI_VENDOR_ID_INTEL ...

https://lore.kernel.org/r/20190927144421.22608-1-kherbst@redhat.com
says Skylake and Kaby Lake SoCs are affected.  But here you only check
for one Device ID?
