Because most computers don't run on HiSilicon chips.

If it's really needed, shouldn't ARCH_HISI depend on it?

In any case, I submitted this, because the driver enabled itself when I
turned on COMPILE_TEST, which was entirely unexpected. Unless I'm
mistaken, defaulting to off seems to be a standard practice for most
drivers, including thermal.

Would this be a better idea?

  default y if ARCH_HISI

Thanks
