Well the re-enable Hi-Z mode on IRQ workaround you implemented gives
this behavior. While also ensuring that if the device dies because
of an empty battery it can still be recharged (since then the IRQ
handler won't run).

I see that you have posted a v2 adding the workaround, thank you.

Note that in the mean time I did find a way to make things work
without the workaround:

1. Set current limit of Vboost output of main charger high enough
that both the external usb device can use 500mA + the secondary
charger can charge the secondary battery (from the main battery)
with 500 mA

2. Sleep 300 ms for the situation to stabilize

3. Set Hi-Z mode on secondary charger so that it stops charging
from the main battery.

I just finished running a whole bunch of tests with this setup and
it works well.

I do like the v2 of your patches better because that really guarantees
the second charger is "offline" when we want it to be offline and allows
me to put it in Hi-Z mode before enabling the 5v boost output on the
main charger instead of letting the secondary battery briefly charge
from the main battery. It also allows me to remove a struct delayed_Work
which I added for the 300ms delay ...

Can you please let me know if you want to move forward with your v2,
or since that version is not strictly necessary if you would prefer
to rollback to v1 ?

Then I can adjust my patches accordingly before posting them

I was pretty much about to post them just now :)

Regards,

Hans
