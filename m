That's why I also added a success message, to distinguish this case.

Not phone users, but people making their own kernels/distributions. Those people
monitor dmesg, and out of 4 distros or more nobody noticed there was an issue
(despite the complaints of overheating by their users).

So I thought some warning may be in order, so that distro people more easily
notice they have misconfigured the kernel or sometging.

End users really don't care about dmesg.
