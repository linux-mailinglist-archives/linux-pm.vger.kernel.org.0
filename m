Not sure if that is comprehensible by everybody.  The point is that
unbound devices are left in D0 but are nevertheless allowed to
(logically) runtime suspend.  And pci_pm_runtime_suspend() may call
pci_save_state() while config space isn't fully initialized yet,
or pci_pm_runtime_resume() may call pci_restore_state() (via
pci_pm_default_resume_early()) and overwrite initialized config space
with uninitialized data.

Have you actually seen this happen in practice?  Normally enumeration
happens during subsys_initcall time, when user space isn't running yet.
Hotplug may be an exception though.

Patch LGTM in principle, but adding Ilpo to cc who is refactoring PCI
resource allocation and may judge whether this can actually happen.

I think the code comments you're adding are a little verbose and a simple
/* acquired in pci_pm_init() */ in pci_bus_add_device() may be sufficient.

Also, I think it is neither necessary nor useful to actually cc the e-mail
to stable@vger.kernel.org if you include a stable designation in the
patch.  I believe stable maintainers only pick up backports from that list,
not patches intended for upstream.

Thanks,

Lukas
