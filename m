I'm not sure why though.

Not removed, but replaced.

The set_active flag is only set for devices with
DPM_FLAG_SMART_SUSPEND set and devices depended on by them.  Also, it
is only set for devices whose must_resume is set, which for devices
with DPM_FLAG_SMART_SUSPEND means that they literally must be resumed.
Consequently, the devices depended on by them also must be resumed.

As stated above, if a device with DPM_FLAG_SMART_SUSPEND has
power.must_resume set, it must be resumed.  Therefore, all of the
devices depended on by it must be resumed (literally, they need to be
powered up and configured to work).  This is already a rule without
the patch.

Accordingly, they all effectively will be "active" and so their
runtime PM status must reflect this.

I don't see anything that cannot work, but I see why it is broken
without this patch.

It would be good to actually identify the cases in which it may not
work and they can be fixed on top of this patch.
