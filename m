acpi_pci_bridge_d3() currently depends only on HotPlugSupportInD3 for
the Root Port.  This patch adds dependencies on _S0W (if it exists)
and _PRW.  The _PRW connection is indirect; this patch tests
device->wakeup.flags.valid, which is only set in this path:

  acpi_add_single_object
    acpi_bus_get_wakeup_device_flags
      if (!acpi_has_method(device->handle, "_PRW"))
	return;
      acpi_bus_extract_wakeup_device_power_package
	acpi_evaluate_object("_PRW") 
	if (package)
	  wakeup->gpe_device = ...
	  wakeup->gpe_number = ...
      device->wakeup.flags.valid = acpi_wakeup_gpe_init(device);

So IIUC the proposed logic here is:

  - If Root Port has no _PRW, we can't put this device in D3 (this is
    new).

  - If Root Port has _S0W that says wake is not supported in D3hot
    (Linux sets OSC_SB_PR3_SUPPORT), we can't put this device in D3
    (this is also new).

  - If Root Port has HotPlugSupportInD3, we can put this device in D3
    (this is the existing behavior).

Proposed text:

  acpi_pci_bridge_d3(dev) returns "true" if "dev" is a hotplug bridge
  that can handle hotplug events while in D3.  Previously this meant:

    1) "dev" has a _PS0 or _PR0 method, or

    2) The Root Port above "dev" has a _DSD with a
       "HotPlugSupportInD3" property with value 1.

  This did not consider_S0W, which tells us the deepest D-state from
  which a device can wake itself (ACPI v6.4, sec 7.3.20).

  On some platforms, e.g., AMD Yellow Carp, firmware may supply
  "HotPlugSupportInD3" even though _S0W tells us the device cannot
  wake from D3hot.  With the previous code, these devices could be put
  in D3hot and hotplugged devices would not be recognized.

  If _S0W exists and says the Root Port cannot wake itself from D3hot,
  return "false" to indicate that "dev" cannot handle hotplug events
  while in D3.

    1) "dev" has a _PS0 or _PR0 method, or

    2a) The Root Port above "dev" has _PRW and

    2b) If the Root Port above "dev" has _S0W, it can wake from D3hot or
        D3cold and

    2c) The Root Port above "dev" has a _DSD with a
        "HotPlugSupportInD3" property with value 1.

The _S0W part makes sense to me.  The _PRW part hasn't been explained
yet.  We didn't depend on it before, but we think it's safe to depend
on it now?

In the commit log and comments, can we be more explicit about whether
"D3" means "D3hot" or "D3cold"?

I think it would make more sense to move the generic easy tests
earlier, before acpi_dev_get_property(), since there's no need to look
up the property if we might fail later.  E.g., something like the
patch below, so it's:

  if (!adev->wakeup.flags.valid)
    return false;

  status = acpi_evaluate_integer(adev->handle, "_S0W", NULL, &state);
  if (ACPI_SUCCESS(status) && state < ACPI_STATE_D3_HOT)
    return false;

  if (!acpi_dev_get_property(adev, "HotPlugSupportInD3",
                             ACPI_TYPE_INTEGER, &obj) &&
      obj->integer.value == 1)
    return true;

  return false;
