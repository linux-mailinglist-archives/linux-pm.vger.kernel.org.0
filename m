I had not tried this before, as I assumed the comment was still
relevant. I did test that now and it works! I can't detect any
regressions.

Do you want to send this in or should I do that?

I don't know much about the PCI core (let alone spec), so that seemed
like the least intrusive way to fix this for me.

Thanks!
