The strength of the menu governor was the ability to find repeating intervals but with he multiplication of the cores, the IPIs were introduced which increased the entropy of the busy-idle cycles duration, thus making the duration much more random and altering the menu governor prediction accuracy.

Daniel if you're testing both and struggle to find a strong advantage
for teo:
teo currently has the intercept-mechanism, trying to find a shallower state
until we are at < 1/2 intercepts as wakeups.
Rafael's idea was to make this configurable, e.g. allowing only 20%
intercepts (more aggressive in selecting shallow states) or 80% (less
aggressive in selecting shallow states).
This would be a minimal change in code and the rest of teo is unaffected,
but gives users a choice, something menu won't offer.
