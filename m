I think I asked you to test the PCIe delay patch and it did not help but
I wonder if it helps if we increase the delay. As an experiment could
you try Bjorn's pci/pm branch. The last two commits are for the delay.

If you could pull that branch and apply the following patch on top and
give it a try? Then post the dmesg somewhere so we can see whether it
did the delay at all.
