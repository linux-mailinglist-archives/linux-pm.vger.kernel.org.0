Which kind of demonstrates the problem with the proposed approach
which is based on speculation.

I'm not sure how this is related to what I said above.

I'm still not sure if runtime-suspending them when they have no
drivers is a good idea.

It might be better to somehow do the pm_runtime_allow() automatically
in local_pci_probe() if the usage counter is 1 and power.runtime_auto
is false after running the driver's ->probe() callback.
