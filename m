And it does, until the "allow" counterpart of it is called.

The confusing part here is that the "allow" counterpart is called from
a sysfs attribute.

So the purpose of this "forbid" call in pci_pm_init() is to "block"
runtime PM for PCI devices by default, but allow user space to
"unblock" it later.

Would adding a comment to that effect next to that call be useful?
