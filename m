That sounds plausible, but of course nothing there is specific to the
Intel Gateway, so we should implement this generically so it would
work on all hardware.

I'm not sure what the interface should look like -- should it be a
low-level interface as you propose where userspace would have to
identify each link of interest, or is there some system-wide
power/performance knob that could tune all links?  Cc'd Rafael and
linux-pm in case they have ideas.
