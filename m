I do read kerneldoc, but I *rely* on the code, and it's nice when I
can match up the kerneldoc with what the code is doing :)

Part of my confusion is that "passing control to platform firmware"
isn't particularly useful in itself because it doesn't give a clue
about what firmware is *doing*.  Without knowing what it does, we
can't reason about how kernel's actions interact with firmware's
actions.

I assume this is really a case of "the kernel doesn't know *what* to
do, but platform firmware does," so in principle the kernel *could*
undo the SXIO/SXFP/SXLF magic if it knew what to do.

So IIUC the comment should say something like:

  SXIO/SXFP/SXLF turns off power to the Thunderbolt controller.  We
  don't know how to turn it back on again, but firmware does, so we
  can only use SXIO/SXFP/SXLF if we're suspending via firmware.

Actually, it sounds like the important thing is that we rely on the
firmware *resume* path to turn on the power again.

pm_resume_via_firmware() *sounds* like it would be appropriate, but
the kerneldoc says that's for use after resume, and it tells us
whether firmware has *already* handled the wakeup event.  And
PM_SUSPEND_FLAG_FW_RESUME isn't set until after we've run these
suspend_late fixups, so it wouldn't work here.
