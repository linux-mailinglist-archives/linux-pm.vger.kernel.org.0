It's hard to say for all use cases, but there are some easy to measure
and understand:

1. Long scenarios with heavy GPU usage (e.g. gaming). Power on CPUs
    built from High-Performance cells can be affected by +20% and after
    ~1min
2. Longer recording with heavy ISP usage, similar to above

In those two, it's sufficient to update the EM every 1-3sec to reach
this +20% after 60sec. Although, at the beginning when the GPU starts
heating the updates should happen a bit more often.

There are some more complex cases, e.g. when more than 1 Big CPU does
heavy computations and the heat is higher than normal EM model of
single CPU (even for that scenario profile). Then the updates to EM
can go a bit more often (it depends what the platform would like
to leverage and achieve w/ SW).
