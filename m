BTW, the problem at hand is not that s2idle in particular needs to be
treated in a special way (this appears to be the source of all
confusion here).  The problem is that the kernel cannot undo the
SXIO/SXFP/SXLF magic without passing control to the platform firmware.

And "passing contol to the platform firmware" doesn't mean "executing
some AML" here, because control remains in the kernel when AML is
executed.  "Passing control to the platform firmware" means letting
some native firmware code (like SMM code) run which happens at the end
of S2/S3/S4 suspend transitions and it does not happen during S1
(standby) and s2idle suspend transitions.

That's why using SXIO/SXFP/SXLF is only valid during S2/S3/S4 suspend
transitions and it is not valid during s2idle and S1 suspend
transitions (and yes, S1 is also affected, so s2idle is not special in
that respect at all).

IMO the changelog of the patch needs to be rewritten, but the code
change made by it is reasonable.

Cheers!
