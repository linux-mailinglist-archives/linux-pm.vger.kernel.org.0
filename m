If the root cause of your issue with the inability to shut down is that 
there were devices left in D0 at shutdown and the firmware was expecting 
them to be powered down then this patch may help your system.

If it is a different problem then I wouldn't expect any differences from 
this patch.

As a debugging tactic for your problem you can try to save your shutdown 
log to the EFI pstore by adding this to your kernel command line for a 
boot.

efi_pstore.pstore_disable=N printk.always_kmsg_dump=Y

Then the next boot if you have the systemd-pstore service enabled it 
will move the log into /var/lib/systemd/pstore.

If you don't have it enabled you can run this to manually do it one time.

sudo systemctl start systemd-pstore.service

Hopefully that log will be helpful in identifying your problem.

Note: Don't do this "every" boot; it's going to apply more wear to the 
NVRAM backing.
