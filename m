I think I have misunderstood what you said.

I also think that Windows 7 and before didin't do RTD3, but it did PCI
PM nevertheless and platform firmware could expect it to behave in a
specific way in that respect.  That expected behavior seems to have
changed in the next generations of Windows, as reflected by the OS
version and _REV checks in ASL.

OK, so the very existence of the two paths means that the OS behavior
expected by the firmware in the two cases represented by them is
different.  Presumably, the expected hardware configuration in which
the AML runs also is different in these two cases.

I'll look at it in detail when I have some more time later.

But I don't think that the case at hand is covered by this at all.

In the "generic" case covered by the doc, the world is simple: the
device has a PMCSR and some AML, possibly to support D3cold.  You use
both and are happy.  And you don't care about the upstream PCIe port
at all.

In the case at had you need a power resource at the PCIe port level to
put the downstream device into D3cold (BTW, I'm not even sure if the
port really is power managed by this at all), so they both are treated
kind of as a combo.  Quite a bit more complicated in my view.

OK, thanks!

If I have the time next week, I'll try to prototype patch to implement
this idea.
