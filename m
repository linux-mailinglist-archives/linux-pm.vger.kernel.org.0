Any insights always appreciated.
I have an OSPM talk accepted about the recent EAS overutilized
proposals, which does touch upon being able to switch out of EAS
quickly enough, too. I will be including some x86 results from our
test machine, too.

We've had something like this actually, you might be interested [1].
You'd want something more flexible in terms of the margins (or a
non-energy-based approach based on e.g. spare-cap [2]), but just
sidestepping the CPU selection within the cluster?

Is there anything specifically worrying you about frequent e-core
wakeup migrations? A few things come to mind immediately like:
Idle state latency, cache, DVFS, per-core internals like branch
predictor training, maybe turbo states would also favor the same
core(s) to be active?
(I've played with the series, too and still have lots of questions
on how this interact with turbo states, but given that we can't
really deterministically trigger them, trying to experiment/measure
anything seems rather futile?)

Interestingly if anything we were more interested in reducing CPU
wakeups in the big cores, because of their higher static leakage,
while little cores have low static leakage and low cpuidle wakeup
cost and latency.

[1]
It should be noted that we were always more concerned between the
uArch differences instead of breaking ties between intra-cluster CPUs,
simply because that's where the big efficiency gains are.

[2]
Vincent Guittot's is currently proposing this, I don't think it would
work well ootb because of the single-OPP approach you took, but maybe
going from "same OPP" to e.g. "5% cap diff" remedies that?
https://lore.kernel.org/lkml/20241217160720.2397239-4-vincent.guittot@linaro.org/


Anyway to provide something useful on this thread as well, testing
on our Raptor Lake with nosmt (=8+8) (note that this doesn't necessarily
translate into the lunar lake series that is the focus here).
I can reproduce the same efficiency gains of around 20-25% on
common workloads, e.g. 20 iterations of 5mins Firefox 4K youtube
video playback (Acquired by RAPL power/energy-cores/ in Joules):

EAS:
628.6145 +-30.4479693342421
CAS:
829.172 +-29.422507961369337
(-24.2% energy used with EAS)

FWIW Dietmar's patch of adding cpu_capacity sysfs for the intel_pstate
setup path is pretty handy for testing at least, maybe it could still
be considered for upstream:
