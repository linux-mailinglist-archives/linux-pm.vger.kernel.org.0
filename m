So I looked a bit into it, unfortunately I don't have the box in question.

(similar on all CPUs, i.e. it never accounts any (!WFI) cpuidle states
as entered, only as rejected. (for both with and without this patch,
rejected is by factor 10 or so bigger with this patch, which is
what Marc is saying and complaining about.)
If cpuidle enter fails this will report as 0 idle residency in cpuidle.c,
which indeed makes these statistical tests bogus.
I guess we could add a safeguard here again that at least requires
most of the values to be != 0? The real issue is that cpuidle is
being used while it's clearly not working as expected. So we could
also bake some sanity-checks into cpuidle core.
I'd be curious if this is more common or is this really the only
platform were this occurs (and went unnoticed all this time).
