Actually, that is an extremely good point I didn't think about.

Thinking about it now, one thing is missing: a check if _S0W is
present, because the lack of it means "any power state should be
fine".

With this check in place we would only avoid taking
"HotPlugSupportInD3" into account if it were not consistent with the
other settings and if that didn't work, we would end up in the quirks
territory this way or another.
