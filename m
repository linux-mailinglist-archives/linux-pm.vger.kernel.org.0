the issue is not AML related at all as I am able to reproduce this
issue without having to invoke any of that at all, I just need to poke
into the PCI register directly to cut the power. The register is not
documented, but effectively what the AML code is writing to as well.
Of course it might also be that the code I was testing it was doing
things in a non conformant way and I just hit a different issue as
well, but in the end I don't think that the AML code is the root cause
of all of that.
