Rafael, do you know anything about this?  If ACPI has some sort of
workaround so it can execute the method correctly anyway, maybe we
should remove or reword the warning?

Or if this does prevent execution of the method, maybe we need to add
a workaround since the problem is so prevalent in the field?
