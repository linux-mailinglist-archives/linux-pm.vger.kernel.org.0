I see this doc line confused you, and I can sympathize.

IIUC, the parenthetical means that sysfs *uses* pm_runtime_forbid() to
"effectively prevent runtime power management"; pm_runtime_forbid() does
not block user space from doing anything.

I tried to elaborate on the API doc confusion above. But frankly, I'm
not sure how best to explain runtime PM.

Both v1 and v2 mention that the sysfs 'power/control' file can override
the kernel calling pm_runtime_forbid(). They don't mention the usage
count, since that's an implementation detail IMO. (To me, the mental
model works best if "usage count" (usually get()/put()) is considered
mostly orthogonal to forbid()/allow()/sysfs, because "forbid()" can be
overridden at any time.)

This is also covered here:

https://docs.kernel.org/power/runtime_pm.html#runtime-pm-initialization-device-probing-and-removal

"In principle, this mechanism may also be used by the driver to
effectively turn off the runtime power management of the device until
the user space turns it on."

But admittedly, I find the runtime PM API surface to be enormous, and
its documentation ... not very helpful to outsiders. It's pretty much
written by and for PM experts. Case in point: you read and quoted the
appropriate docs, but it still misled you quite a bit :(

I'm more tempted to try to improve the runtime PM docs than to try to
make up for them in the commit message, but maybe I can be convinced
otherwise.

There are only 3 drivers that call pci_resize_resource(). I looked into
them, and it looks like they all hold pm_runtime_* references while
doing this, or are calling it during pci_driver probe(), which docs say
will hold a reference.

https://docs.kernel.org/power/pci.html#device-runtime-power-management

So they should all be OK too.

Sure, thanks for the pointers. I'm happy to look into other areas if you

Thanks for looking things over.
