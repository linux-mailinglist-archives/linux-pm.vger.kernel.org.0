If you clear pdev->pm_cap as in 434fdb51513b ("drm/nouveau: workaround
runpm fail by disabling PCI power management on certain intel
bridges"), we'll assume the device doesn't support any PCI power
management, which means the PCI core should leave the device in D0.

D3cold is handled by ACPI or other platform means.  I don't know how
to disable that part.
