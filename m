Pardon my ignorance here, but doesn't that implementation above work 
only in case you have two chargers ? Note that in my case, I have one 
charger and one battery.

If we want to have HiZ mode support upstream, we might as well keep the 
workaround to retain the HiZ mode across replugs. So let's move forward 
with v2 ?

Sorry about the delay this week.
