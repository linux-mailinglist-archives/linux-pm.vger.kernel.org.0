Thanks for the notice.  It's been through Intel CI and tests on a few
local machines, maybe we haven't checked carefully those errors but
only concentrated on the other issues, as it seems.

There were two problems: one was the runtime PM being kicked off even
during the PCI driver remove call, and another was the proper runtime
PM setup after re-binding.

For avoiding the former, only the pm_runtime_forbid() (and maybe
pm_runtime_dont_use_autosuspend(), too) would suffice?  Also, for PCI
device, no need for pm_runtime_set_supended() at remove, right?


thanks,

Takashi
