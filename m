I'm coming back to you with some public information about our WFI
idle state. WFI can be not only the clock-gating thing, it can
automatically put the CPU into retention mode, which saves the
static power.

That's why I said WFI can be really efficient and we can/should
leverage that. That's also why we shouldn't assume power numbers
based on statistics of idle states (especially available in kernel).

Please check TRM for Cortex-X1, section:
A4.6.4 Core dynamic retention mode [1].

The period after which the HW can decide to enter retention mode
is configurable via registers. It's up to our vendors to experiment
and implement the right configuration.

It's up to the vendor to try that and some of them do this AFAIK.
We should really talk based on the data including power from experiments
and also investigate deeper if the right configurations are
used in HW.

Regards,
Lukasz
