When ACPI 5 was published the workaround to disable RPM in general
was in place already. I'd assume that the majority of users does not
opt in for RPM, therefore it may be hard to find out whether any
system with ACPI 5 or ACPI 6 suffers from the same problem as the
affected old systems.

>From "Documentation/power/pci.rst":
If a PCI driver implements the runtime PM callbacks and intends to use the
runtime PM framework provided by the PM core and the PCI subsystem, it needs
to decrement the device's runtime PM usage counter in its probe callback
function.  If it doesn't do that, the counter will always be different from
zero for the device and it will never be runtime-suspended.

Having said that I don't see how there can be a RPM-related problem w/o
the driver calling one of the RPM put functions. Maybe some of the problems
in the past were caused by PCI core bugs that have long been fixed.

To reduce the risk we could enable RPM for a certain subset of PCI devices
only in a first step, e.g. for PCIe devices.
