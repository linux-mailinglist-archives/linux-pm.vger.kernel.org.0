In an ideal world, we would know which commit introduced s2idle and
hence the possibility of hitting this bug, and we would add a Fixes:
tag for that commit so we could connect this fix with it.

Apart from that, what I don't like about this (and about the original
1df5172c5c25) is that there's no connection to a spec or to documented
behavior of the device or of suspend/resume.

For example, "With s2idle, the machine isn't suspended via ACPI, so
the AML code which powers the controller off isn't executed."  AFAICT
that isn't actually a required, documented property of s2idle, but
rather it reaches into the internal implementation.

The code comment "If suspend mode is s2idle, power won't get restored
on resume" is similar.  !pm_suspend_via_firmware() tells us that
platform firmware won't be invoked.  But the connection between *that*
and "power won't get restored" is unexplained.

Thanks for looking at this!
