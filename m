Yes, we should but there is the series for nvidia (pointed in the 
changelog) which need a slight refresh for the bindings AFAIR. That 
series is since March 2023 and Thierry seems busy [1]. I'm holding the 
hardening since then.

So I don't know how to make progress on this? I was assuming we can 
merge this series and let the compiler recall what has to be fixed.

and as soon as it is fixed, we convert the WARNING to ERROR :P
