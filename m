OK.  I think it's worth mentioning _PRW even if we don't have a good
explanation for it.  For someone bringing up a platform like this,
that will be a better hint than "adev->wakeup.flags.valid" alone.

Linux advertises OSC_SB_PR3_SUPPORT, so I think we are checking for
D3hot.  Of course, if a device can't wake from D3hot, it can't wake
from D3cold either.

You didn't *add* any D3 comments and only quoted the Microsoft doc, so
maybe nothing to change in this patch.  It's confusing to me that the
existing code, like acpi_pci_bridge_d3(), pci_bridge_d3_possible(),
pci_bridge_d3_force, etc., are all ambiguous.
