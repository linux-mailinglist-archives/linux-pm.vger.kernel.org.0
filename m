It doesn't need to work this way IMV.

It may also work by allowing drivers (or whatever kernel entities are
interested in that) to subscribe to it, so that they get notified
whenever a new value is written to it by user space (eg. each driver
may be able to register a callback to be invoked when that happens).
The information coming from user space will just be passed to the
subscribers of that interface and they will do about it what they want
(eg. it may be translated into a value to be written to a
performance-vs-power interface provided by the platform or similar).

This really is similar to having a class interface with one file per
"subscribed" device except that the aggregation is done in the kernel
and not in user space and the subscribers need not be related to
specific devices.  It still allows to avoid exposing the low-level
interfaces to user space verbatim and it just passes the "policy"
choice from user space down to the entities that can take it into
account.
