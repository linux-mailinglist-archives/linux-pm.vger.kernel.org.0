Hi Bjorn,

I added those details in cover letter as you suggested to add them in
cover letter.
"PM framework expectes parent runtime pm enabled before enabling runtime
pm of the child. As PCIe starfive device is enabling runtime pm after
the pci_host_probe which enables runtime pm of the child device i.e for
the bridge device a warning is shown saying "pcie-starfive 940000000.pcie:
Enabling runtime PM for inactive device with active children" and also
shows possible circular locking dependency detected message.

As it is must to enable parent device's runtime PM before enabling child's
runtime pm as the pcie-starfive device runtime pm is enabled after child
runtime starfive device is seeing the warning.

In the first patch fix the pcie-starfive driver by enabling runtime
pm before calling pci_host_probe().

All other PCIe controller drivers are enabling runtime pm before
calling pci_host_probe() which is as expected so don't require any
fix like pcie-starfive driver."

yes this is correct requirement only. Do you want us to add this for
this patch .
