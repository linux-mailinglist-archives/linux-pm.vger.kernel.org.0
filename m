The instrumentation, absolutely.  We need something about what was
already enabled and when we change things.

I don't really want a parallel approach because I don't think it would
ever converge again.  BUT I think you're still OK for VMD, because I
think the default should be PCIE_LINK_STATE_ALL, and when we carve out
the exceptions that would not be in vmd.c, and it's easy to say that
there's no exception for VMD.
