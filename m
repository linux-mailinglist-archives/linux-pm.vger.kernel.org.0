I'm not completely clear on the semantics of the .shutdown()
interface.  The doc at
https://git.kernel.org/pub/scm/linux/kernel/git/torvalds/linux.git/tree/include/linux/device/driver.h?id=v6.10#n73
says "@shutdown: Called at shut-down time to quiesce the device"

Turning off device interrupts and DMA *would* fit within the idea of
quiescing the device.  Does that also include changing the device
power state?  I dunno.  The power state isn't *mentioned* in the
.shutdown() context, while it *is* mentioned for .suspend().

IIUC, this patch and commit log uses "shutdown" to refer to a
system-wide *poweroff*, which is a different concept despite using the
same "shutdown" name.

So should the system poweroff procedure use .suspend()?  Should it use
both .shutdown() and .suspend()?  I think it only uses .shutdown()
today:

  kernel_power_off
    kernel_shutdown_prepare(SYSTEM_POWER_OFF)
      device_shutdown
        while (!list_empty(&devices_kset->list))
          dev->bus->shutdown(dev)
            pci_device_shutdown

There are several driver .shutdown() methods that do things like this:

  e1000_shutdown
    if (system_state == SYSTEM_POWER_OFF)
      pci_set_power_state(pdev, PCI_D3hot)

Maybe that's the right thing and should be done by the PCI core, which
is similar to what you propose here.  But I think it muddies the
definition of .shutdown() a bit by mixing in power management stuff.
