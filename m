The controller is effectively a Root Complex, which may contain
several Root Ports.  I have the impression that the Synopsys
controller only supports a single Root Port, but that's just a detail
of the Synopsys implementation.  I think it should be possible to
configure the width/speed of each Root Port individually.

What if there's a switch?  If we change the width/speed of the link
between the Root Port and the Switch Upstream Port, that doesn't do
anything about the links from the Switch Downstream Ports.

Don't the Link Control and related registers in PCIe spec give us
enough control to manage the link width/speed of *all* links,
including those from Root Ports and Switch Downstream Ports?

If the Synopsys controller requires controller-specific registers,
that sounds to me like it doesn't quite conform to the spec.  Maybe
that means we would need some sort of quirk or controller callback?
