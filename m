I don't know :) If we want to bite the bullet, let's do it. Otherwise, let's
keep waiting for the time to come ;) For sure there will be breakages
reported, but it won't be like on x86 which people use for day to day work.
There are IBM Power and MIPS based servers using devicetree as well, so they
might also get impacted.

But it would be the optimal test bed if we ever want to start enabling ASPM by
default.

Sure. Even if we want to make it pci_info(), I think it would be worth doing it
as it will make the reporting much easier.

Let me know if I can proceed with this.
