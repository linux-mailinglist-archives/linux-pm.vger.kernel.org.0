Hi,

It's a oneliner, but I might as well.

I don't really know *why* it's doing all of this. Qualcomm doesn't share any documentation.

It' just based on the freely-available msm-3.10 kernel driver. Probably just a HW specific.

That's sounds very good. I did not think of this approach, but I will incorporate it

into the next revision.

Sorry, I am not sure what you're referring to, the calibrate_8976 function?

No idea, but judging by the line:

" adc_code_of_tempx = base0[i] + p[i]; "

it's probably some hw-specific offset value.

Weird. I did not get slope calculation issues even with this, but perhaps

I was just lucky.

All TSENS consumers had this style, probably to make it easier to compare with the

downstream driver should there arise any human errors.

Does MSM8994_NON_TWOPT_DEFAULT_VALUE sound good? It doesn't exactly

roll of the tongue but I don't have many better ideas..

Thanks, didn't know about this.



> What about replacing 16 by TSENS_SENSOR_MAX ?

If you mean this 8994-specific function exactly, then it'd probably cause

more confusion than help as we might find out that some SoC using TSENSv1

has even more sensors.

Here TSENS_SENSOR_MAX does make sense.

I will add this to my to-do list, but no promises on this landing anytime soon :/



Thanks for the thorough review,
