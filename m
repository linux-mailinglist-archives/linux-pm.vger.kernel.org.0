Thanks for these.  You don't happen to have URLs for those Ubuntu
commits, do you?  E.g., https://git.kernel.org/linus/4ff116d0d5fd
(which was reverted by a7152be79b62 ("Revert "PCI/ASPM: Save L1 PM
Substates Capability for suspend/resume"")).

Thank you very much for raising this again.  We really need to make
some progress, and Mika recently posted a patch to add the
4ff116d0d5fd functionality again:
https://lore.kernel.org/r/20231002070044.2299644-1-mika.westerberg@linux.intel.com

The big problem is that it works on *most* systems, but it still seems
to break a few.  So Mika's current patch relies on a denylist of
systems where we *don't* restore the substates.

It's possible we'll have to give in and use a denylist, but it's
obviously not ideal because (a) we don't know *why* it doesn't work on
those systems, and (b) it means substates work before suspend but not
after resume, which is a poor user experience.
