If I were to guess, I would say that AML tries to access memory that
is not accessible while suspended, probably PCI config space.

The DSDT alone may not be sufficient.

Can you please create a bug entry at bugzilla.kernel.org for this
issue and attach the full output of acpidump from one of the affected
machines to it?  And please let me know the number of the bug.

Also please attach the output of dmesg including a suspend-resume
cycle including dock disconnection while suspended and the ACPI
messages quoted below.

This list is not the right channel for inquiries related to Intel
support, we can only help you as Linux kernel developers in this
venue.

First, please use proper Intel support channels for BIOS-related inquiries.

Second, please open a bug as suggested above and let's use it for
further communication regarding this issue as far as Linux is
concerned.

Thanks!
