Yeah, right. Atleast ACPI has its own way of handling D3Cold and that's what I
meant. There is no such option available for DT right now. I was shoping that
once this NVMe issue is resolved, then I could look into D3Cold for DT
platforms.

Right, but the device driver needs to have some idea about what state PCI core
is going to choose for the device. I believe that's the purpose of
pci_choose_state() API. More below...

Ok, IIUC you are talking about something like this?

	static int nvme_suspend(struct device *dev)
	{
		...

		if (pm_suspend_via_firmware() || !ctrl->npss || ... ||
		    pci_choose_state(pdev, PMSG_SUSPEND) == PCI_D3cold)
			return nvme_disable_prepare_reset(ndev, true);

		/* continue using protocol specific low power state */

		...
	}

Here, pci_choose_state() should tell the driver if the device should enter
D3Cold. ACPI already supports this API, now I need to add DT support (which is
not straightforward, but doable). Since this API is already exported, I think it
makes perfect sense to use it here (and other drivers for similar usecase).

Ok. I believe this could be addressed in pci_choose_state() itself if required.

Yeah, that would be a concern.
