Right, with time the documentation is updated and now it has mixed
the purpose of both these files IMO.

Yes, this is a valid concern. The changes in documentation have been
there for many years and changing the behavior now is not going to be
an easy / right thing to do.

Hmm, having 3 files would confuse people even more I guess. I wanted
to get this sorted to have the same behavior for all platforms, but it
seems somewhat difficult to achieve now.

What about this, hopefully this doesn't break any existing platforms
and fix the problems for ARM (and others):

- scaling_cur_freq:

  Returns the frequency of the last P-state requested by the scaling
  driver from the hardware. For set_policy() drivers, use the ->get()
  callback to get a value that can provide the best estimate to user.

  To make this work, we can add get() callback to intel and amd pstate
  drivers, and use arch_freq_get_on_cpu().

  This will keep the current behavior intact for such drivers.

- cpuinfo_cur_freq:

  Currently this file is available only if the get() callback is
  available. Maybe we can keep this behavior as is, and expose this
  now for both the pstate drivers (once above change is added). We
  will be left with only one driver that doesn't provide the get()
  callback: pasemi-cpufreq.c

  Coming back to the implementation of the file read operation, I
  think the whole purpose of arch_freq_get_on_cpu() was to get a
  better estimate (which may not be perfect) of the frequency the
  hardware is really running at (in the last window) and if a platform
  provides this, then it can be given priority over the ->get()
  callback in order to show the value to userspace.

  And so, if the platform provides, we can use arch_freq_get_on_cpu()
  first and then the get() callback.

That would leave us to this change for the core, and yes a get()
callback for intel-pstate and amd-pstate:

I think this will also make more sense from documentation's
perspective, which says that:

"In the majority of cases, this is the frequency of the last P-state
requested by the scaling driver from the hardware using the scaling
interface provided by it, which may or may not reflect the frequency
the CPU is actually running at (due to hardware design and other
limitations)."

-- we do this at the core level.

"Some architectures (e.g. x86) may attempt to provide information more
precisely reflecting the current CPU frequency through this attribute,
but that still may not be the exact current CPU frequency as seen by
the hardware at the moment."

-- and this at driver level, as a special case.
