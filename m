I don't see _PS3 (nor _PS0) for that object. If I read it right the GPU
itself is not described in ACPI tables at all.

The root port's _OFF method for the power resource returned by its _PR3.

That should be fine. What I've seen the link goes into L1 when
downstream component is put to D-state (not D0) and then it is put back
to L0 when L2/3 ready is propagated. Eventually it goes into L2 or L3.

There is GPIO for both power and PERST, I think the line here:

  \_SB.SGOV (0x01010004, Zero)

is the one that removes power.

It does and that leaves the link in L0 so it could be that then the
above AML works better or something.

That reminds me, ASPM may have something to do with this as well.

Parent port cannot be lower D-state than the child so I agree it should
stay in D0 as well. However, it seems that what happens is that the
issue goes away :)
