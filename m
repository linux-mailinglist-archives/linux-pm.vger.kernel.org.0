Ah.  So this problem could occur with any device, not just NVMe?  If
so, how do you address that?  Obviously you don't want to patch all
drivers this way.

This is more meaningful to you than to most people because "applying
the standard PCI PM" doesn't tell us what that means in terms of the
device.  Presumably it has something to do with a D-state transition?
I *assume* a suspend might involve the D0 -> D3hot transition you
mention below?

I don't know any of the details, but "failure to take the link down
during D0 -> D3hot transitions" is phrased as though it might be a
hardware erratum.  If this *is* related to an NVMe erratum, that would
explain why you only need to patch the nvme driver, and it would be
useful to mention that in the commit log, since otherwise it sounds
like something that might be needed in other drivers, too.

According to PCIe r5.0 sec 5.3.2, the only legal link states for D3hot
are L1, L2/L3 Ready.  So if you put a device in D3hot and its link
stays in L0, that sounds like a defect.  Is that what happens?

Obviously I'm still confused.  I think it would help if you could
describe the problem in terms of the specific PCIe states involved
(D0, D3hot, L0, L1, L2, L3, etc) because then the spec would help
explain what's happening.
