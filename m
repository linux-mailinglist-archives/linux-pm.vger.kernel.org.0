Right, it's a weak indicator, and I'm aware of it. My thought is:
A massively broken ACPI implementation would have been fixed over
time if there are years between manufacturing date and last BIOS
update. Of course this doesn't have to be true ..

I just had a look at the ACPI spec and maybe we could use the ACPI
version information (major.minor) in the FADT table. E.g. we could
enable runtime pm from version 6.0. That should be reasonable new.
I'm open for any other proposals ..
