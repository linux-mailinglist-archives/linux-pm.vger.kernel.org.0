Thanks, and I agree with your statement, but at this point I think
only Intel can help out digging deeper as I see no way to debug this
further.

correct. It By the way, it doesn't matter if I put the device into D1
instead, as long as the device is not in D0 state before putting it
into D3cold, it fails.

makes sense, I could ,orthogonal to this, make the code more robust if
we hit issues like this in the future. What I am mostly wondering
about is, why pci core doesn't give up if the device doesn't come back
from D3cold? It sounds like, that the most sane thing to do here is to
just give up and fail runtime_resume and report errors back to
userspace trying to make use of the devices.

yeah.. I try to get more infos on that. But at least for me (and it
might be a distribution thing) if I execute lspci, the system shuts
down, or at least tries to and might fail.

those are registers on the bridge controller and are using inside ACPI
to power down the link. Depending on the OS detected other methods are
used afaik.

one big one is https://bugzilla.kernel.org/show_bug.cgi?id=3D156341 but
it's filled with a lot of different reports, but I am sure most of
them point to this very issue.

Sadly nobody thought of checking lspci with runpm disabled.. but I
could check for other bugs.

yes, I found this bridge controllers on skylake and kaby lake SoCs,
but I could verify there are systems with a different architecture
(using the "PCI Express Root Port" devices instead of "Processor PCIe
Controller") do not show this issue, so I think it might indeed be
just this one bridge controller. I couldn't verify this issue on any
other so far.

But I could verify this issue with this one bridge controller in
combination with Maxwell, Pascal and Turing Nvidia GPUs.
