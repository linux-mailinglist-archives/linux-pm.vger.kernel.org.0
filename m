This is a known issue. With the initial design of the pwrctrl framework, we
thought that the pwrctrl devices should be created without controller
intervention. But it is proving to be wrong as some controllers expect the
devices to show up before the PHY initialization, as yours.

We are working on a series (almost complete, just needs cleanup) that moves the
pwrctrl creation to a new exported API and allows the controller drivers to call
the API from whereever they want based on the requirement. This series also
fixes the above mentioned hotplug/PERST# issues by scanning all the PCIe nodes
in one shot and creating pwrctrl devices and making use all of them gets probed
(just the pwrctrl drivers, not PCIe client drivers) before deasserting PERST#
and then scanning the bus. This would require all the pwrctrl drivers to be
loaded before probing the controller driver (otherwise, probe deferral will
happen), but that's a valid dependency.

This will allow the PCI core to find all the devices during the initial bus
scan and will fix the resource allocation issue.
