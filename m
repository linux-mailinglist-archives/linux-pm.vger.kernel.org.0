Ugh, no, *NO*! I really expect Intel to do better here!

As I repeated explained with the

"platform/x86/intel: pmc/core: Add Raptor Lake support to pmc core driver"

patch I cannot just go and cherry-pick random patches merged through other trees
because that may cause conflicts and will cause the merge to look really
funky.

There are proper ways to do this and this is not it!

This is something which Intel really *must* do correctly next time because
having this discussion over and over again is becoming very tiresome!

So the proper way to do starts with realizing *beforehand* that things
will not build on top of pdx86/for-next. By like actually doing
a build-test based on top of pdx86/for-next instead of this nonsense of
repeatedly sending me broken patches.

Once you realize this there are a couple of options, these all start
with identifying which tree has the patch on which the other patch depends
iow through which tree / subsystem was "7beade0dd41d x86/cpu: Add several
Intel server CPU model numbers" merged? Based on the name I'm going to
assume this is done through the x86 tree.

Once you have:

1. Realized the patch actually won't build on top of pdx86/for-next
2. Identified which tree has the commit your patch depends on

Then there are several options how to proceed:

1. Since this is a one-liner and it touches a driver which has
seen no other recent changes, you can submit the patch to the
x86/tip tree maintainers instead of to the pdx86 subsystem.

The x86/tip tree maintainers will likely want my ack for merging
this through their tree. For the next version which you should
submit to the x86/tip tree folks, not to the pdx86 list! Feel free
to add my:

Acked-by: Hans de Goede <hdegoede@redhat.com>

and you will want to add a cover-letter explaining why this
is being submitted to the x86/tip tree and my ack is there
to indicate that I believe it is ok for the patch to go
through another tree.

What you would normally do is realize beforehand you want to go
this route and directly submit to the x86/tip maintainers with me
in the Cc asking for my ack for merging through another tree.

Or what you could have done is:

2. Ask the x86 maintainers to create an immutable branch based on
the last rc1 + just the patch adding the defines (which means
realizing before hand you will need this patch in other subsystems
and ask them to do this when *submitting* the patch.

Then I could have merged the immutable-branch and then cleanly
apply your patch on top.

###

What you can *NOT* do is just submit the patch to me and expect me
to somehow magically fix the cross subsystem dependency problems
for you. As the patch submitter any cross subsystem dependency problems
arr *your problem* not mine.

Regards,

Hans
