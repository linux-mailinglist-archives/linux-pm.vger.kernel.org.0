Dear Friend,

Please individual to use it for children of God. With warm hearts I
offer my friendship, and my greetings, and I hope this letter meets
you in good health. It will be surprising to you to receive this
proposal from me since you do not know me personally. However, I am
sincerely seeking your confidence in this transaction, which I propose
with my free mind and as a person of integrity from God. My name is
Mrs. Rosemary Gupta. From Canada. I am married to Dr. Jonathan Gupta
who worked with Canada embassy in Burkina Faso Ouagadougou for nine
years, before he died in the year 2008.

We were married for eleven years without a child. He died after a
brief illness that lasted for four days. Before his death we were both
born again Christians. Since his death i decided not to remarry or get
a child outside my matrimonial home which the Bible spoke against.
When my husband was alive he deposited the sum of =E2=82=AC22 Million euro
lodged consignment boxes with a security company in Burkina Faso
Ouagadougou. Presently, this money is still with the security company
in Burkina Faso Ouagadougou. Resently my doctor told me that i will
take the grace of GOD for me to live four month more due to cancer
problems.

Though what disturbs me mostly is my stroke. Having known my condition
I decided to donate this fund to church and Mosque or still a
Christian individual that will use this fund for churches, orphanages
and widows and also propagating the word of God and to ensure that the
house of God is maintained.

The Bible made us to understand that blessed are the hands that
giving. I took this decision because I don`t have any child that will
inherit this money and my husband's relatives are not Christians and
also not a Muslim I don`t want my husband hard earned money to be
misused by unbelievers. I don`t want a situation where these money
will be used in an ungodly manner, hence the reason for taking this
bold decision. I am not afraid of death hence i know where am going.

I know that am going to be in the bosom of the Lord. Exodus 14vs14
says that the Lord will fight my case and I shall hold my peace. I can
only communication with you via email because of my health.

Although I can do all things through Christ that empowers me. As soon
as I receive your reply I shall give you the contact of the security
Company in Burkina Faso Ouagadougou. I will also send you the deposit
information that will empower you as the original- beneficiary of the
consignment. I want you and your church always pray for me.

My happiness is that i lived a life of a worthy Christian, whoever
that wants to serve the Lord must serve Him in spirit and truth.
Please always be prayerful all through your life.

Thanks for your cooperation.

Best regards,
Mrs. Rosemary Gupta
