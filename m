That does make sense, although I would've liked a bit which would set 
HiZ mode and ignore the charger replug, so the chip would guarantee no 
power draw from the charger until such bit is cleared.

Yes, the HiZ mode itself, since it cannot be made persistent and resets 
itself on replug.

I mean, either
- we drop the HiZ mode support completely
or
- we add HiZ mode + persistency workaround

I don't like the second option, but if you need it and we have no better 
options ... hum ...
