Hi Thanu, Souvik, Sudeep,

Thanks a lot for the prompt reply, and it clarify a lot for
us, comment inline below.

I take another detail read of the spec and as you said,
everything is already there,thanks!. I was misleading by the
CPPC code which it's using the 'Highest Performance' as
the max performance not the 'Nominal Performance', so seems
that 'Highest Performance' is the normal max performance but
not the boost performance.

In fact if a platform provides a value for Highest Performance which is different than Nominal Performance, then the entire range of performance is always requested, which works well for platforms which do boost enable/disable selection at hardware/firmware level.

Yes, so for now, the CPPC code will enable the boost feature in
default if the firmware provides a value for Highest Performance
which is different than Nominal Performance.

Thanks for the clarify, it helps a lot, Xiongfeng prepared
some patches to enable .boost hook, but needs to set the
'Nominal Performance' as the max performance, and
'Highest Performance' is the max boost performance, will
send out for comments.

Best Regards,
Hanjun
