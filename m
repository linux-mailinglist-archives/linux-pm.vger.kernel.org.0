I don't mean to confuse you guys but with this one too, I wonder if you
tried to "disable" the device instead of putting it into D3? On another
thread (Mario at least is aware of this) I mentioned that our PCIe SV
folks identified a couple issues in Linux implementation around power
management and one thing that we are missing is to disable I/O and MMIO
upon entering D3.

I know this is about entering S5 (power off) but I wonder if simply
disabling the device (I/O, MMIO and bus mastering) could stop it from
waking up? To my understanding this can be interpreted as quiesce too :)
Something like the below patch (it also includes the runtime suspend
path which should not matter here. This is the similar patch I shared in
another thread).
