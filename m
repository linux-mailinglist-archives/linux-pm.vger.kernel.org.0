The macros for the individual speeds (e.g. PCI_EXP_LNKCAP_SLS_2_5GB)
already have code comments which describe their new meaning.

I guess the reason why the code comment for PCI_EXP_LNKCAP_SLS wasn't
updated is that it seeks to document the meaning of the "SLS" acronym
(Supported Link Speeds).

But yes, amending that with something like...

/* Max Link Speed (Supported Link Speeds before PCIe r3.1) */

...probably make sense, so feel free to propose that in a separate patch.

Ilpo knows this code better than I do but yes, that's plausible.
The bandwidth controller does't change the speed by itself,
it only monitors speed changes.  But it does provide a
pcie_set_target_speed() API which is called by the thermal driver
as well as the pcie_failed_link_retrain() quirk.  I suspect the
latter is the culprit here.  If that suspicion is correct,
you should be seeing messages such as...

"removing 2.5GT/s downstream link speed restriction"

...in dmesg but I think you wrote that you're not getting any
messages at all, right?  Perhaps if you add "early_printk=efi"
to the kernel command line you may see what's going on.

One idea in this case would be to modify pcie_get_supported_speeds()
such that it filters out any speeds in the Link Capabilities 2 register
which exceed the Max Link Speed in the Link Capabilties register.
However the spec says that software should look at the Link Capabilities 2
register to determine supported speeds if that register is present.
So I think we may not conform to the spec then.

The better option is thus probably to add a DECLARE_PCI_FIXUP_EARLY()
quirk for Titan Ridge which sets the supported_speeds to just 2.5 GT/s.
*If* you want to go with the future-proof option which checks that
just one speed is supported.

Titan Ridge is an old chip.  I'm not sure if newer discrete Thunderbolt
controllers exhibit the same issue but likely not.

Thanks,

Lukas
