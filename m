So my question here would be why is it not powered down always during
system-wide suspend?

Why exactly is it necessary to distinguish one case from the other
(assuming that we are talking about system-wide suspend only)?

There are drivers that use pm_suspend_via_firmware() to check whether
or not something special needs to be done to the device because if
"false" is returned, the platform firmware is not going to remove
power from it.

However, you seem to be talking about the opposite, so doing something
special to the device if "true" is returned.  I'm not sure why this is
necessary.

That's true and so the assumption is that in this case the handling of
all devices will always be the same regardless of which flavor of
system suspend is chosen by user space.

So what would be the problem with powering it down unconditionally?

I see.

Before we're talking about APIs, let's talk about the desired behavior.

It looks like there are cases in which you'd want to turn the device
off completely (say put it into D3cold in the PCI terminology) and
there are cases in which you'd want it to stay in a somewhat-powered
low-power state.

It is unclear to me what they are at this point.
