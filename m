What synchronization issues?

They are in general.

It's just that stuff that was runtime-suspended prior to a system-wide
suspend may need to be resumed and marked as RPM_ACTIVE during
system-wide resume because one of the devices wants/needs to be
resumed then.

If this turns out to be problematic, the problem will need to be
addressed, but for now I'm not seeing why there would be a problem.

Yes.

It hasn't been resumed yet, but it is known that it will be resumed.

> If so, isn't that really the root cause for this problem,

No, it is not.

> or what am I missing?

Essentially, what I said above.

If a device that was suspended prior to a system-wide suspend
wants/needs to be resumed during the subsequent system-wide resume,
and it was runtime-PM-enabled before the suspend transition, it needs
to (a) be runtime-PM-enabled during the subsequent system-wide resume
transition and (b) it also needs to be marked as RPM_ACTIVE because in
fact it is not suspended any more.  The existing code before the patch
takes care of this for the device itself, but not for the devices it
depends on which also need to be resumed (which happens) and marked as
RPM_ACTIVE (which doesn't happen) and the patch just makes sure that
the latter will happen.

Actually, what happens now is that the actual state of the parent
during the system-wide resume, right before re-enabling runtime PM for
it, does not match its runtime PM status which is still RPM_SUSPENDED.
That's what is fixed here and it applies to the parent as well as to
all of the other devices depended on by the child and the parent.
