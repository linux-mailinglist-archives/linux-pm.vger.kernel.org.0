Apologies, I will make sure to CC the list next time.
In any case, I have CC'd the lists in my reply here, which includes
the original submission and your reply above. If that is not
acceptable and you think I should post another mail please let me
know.

Right, I bisected the issue to that commit. Unfortunately the patch
didn't revert cleanly; I can't really revert it without modifying the
other parts of the code. Your help would be appreciated; I can test
any patches.

Exactly that. I only tried waking up by pressing a key on the USB
keyboard (that will become important later...)

Unfortunately after spending far too long looking in the manual and at
the motherboard itself, there appears to be no onboard serial port for
a console.
I've enabled persistent journal flushing to disk, but unfortunately I
think the disk is also offline or systemd misses the flush when the
system hangs.

I re-seated the PCI graphics card and generally inspected inside the case too.
I enabled the onboard VGA (rather than the PCI graphics card) and I
got a console on the screen after the resume, where I could print the
dmesg output.
Something very odd happened this time: when it was in suspend I woke
it up by pressing the power button (rather than pressing a key on the
USB keyboard), and the machine seemed to hang for a few seconds but
eventually recovered.

Now it seems to always recover even by pressing a key on the USB
keyboard. I can't explain why it now works...
I attached a snippet of the kernel log (from a recent mainline) below,
if it's of any use. I will keep stress testing and report back in a
week or so in case there are further issues.


Thanks,

Chris
