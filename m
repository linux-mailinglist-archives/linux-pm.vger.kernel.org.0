Can't you then limit it to those?

I've experienced that Kabylake root ports can enter and exit in D3cold
just fine because we do that for Thunderbolt for example. But that
always requires help from ACPI. If the system is using non-standard ACPI
methods for example that may require some tricks in the driver side.

By works you mean that Windows is able to put it into D3cold and back?
If that's the case it may be that there is some ACPI magic that the
Windows driver does and we of course are missing in Linux.
