The old one interface was enabled by CONFIG_PCIEASPM_DEBUG.  Red Hat
doesn't enable that.  Ubuntu does.  I *thought* we heard from a
Canonical person who said they didn't have any tools that used it, but
I can't find that now.  I don't know about SUSE.

So the idea was to drop it on the theory that nobody is using it.
Possibly that's too aggressive.
