Then why do we need to add any sort of such support which I call "workaround"
in the SCMI genpd driver.

Correct, sorry I was referring to just CPUs and I realise this may not
be any issue with CPUs, so please ignore this comment of mine.

Yes exactly. I see what genpd added and you term as legacy behaviour,
lots of driver have already relied on it though they must deal within
the driver. I don't want to people to just start relying on this new
behaviour we add and then becomes difficult to change or remove.

I don't see any platform upstream with SCMI genpd ATM, so I would rather
fix what is needed in the drivers before enabling in them on these platforms.

That would be ideal, but generally we are never close to the ideal world
