With s2idle, the machine isn't suspended via ACPI, so the AML code
which powers the controller off isn't executed.  The dance to prepare
the controller for power-off consequently isn't necessary but rather
harmful.

To get the same power savings as with ACPI suspend, the controller
needs to be powered off via runtime suspend.  I posted patches for
that back in 2016.  I'm using them on my laptop, they need some
polishing and rebasing before I can repost them due to massive
changes that have happened in the thunderbolt driver in the meantime.
Without these patches, the controller sucks 1.5W of power in s2idle.

Yes I believe the quirk predates the introduction of s2idle by a couple
of years.

The patch looks fine to me.

Thanks,
