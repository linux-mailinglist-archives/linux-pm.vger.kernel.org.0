Hi Nhat,

Thank you for sharing this patch series.
I’ve read through it with great interest.

I’m part of a kernel team working on features related to multi-tier swapping,
and this patch set appears quite relevant
to our ongoing discussions and early-stage implementation.

I had a couple of questions regarding the future direction.

Based on the discussion in [5], it seems there was some exploration
around enabling per-cgroup selection of multiple tiers.
Do you envision the current design evolving in a similar direction
to those past discussions, or is there a different direction you're aiming for?

I noticed that your patch appears to be aligned with the work from Kairui.
It seems like the overall architecture may be headed toward introducing
a virtual swap device layer.
I'm curious if there’s already been any concrete discussion
around this abstraction, especially regarding how it might be layered over
multiple physical swap devices?

From a naive perspective, I imagine that while today’s swap devices
are in a 1:1 mapping with physical devices,
this virtual layer could introduce a 1:N relationship —
one virtual swap device mapped to multiple physical ones.
Would this virtual device behave as a new swappable block device
exposed via `swapon`, or is the plan to abstract it differently?

Thanks again for your work, 
and I would greatly appreciate any insights you could share.

Best regards,  
YoungJun Park
