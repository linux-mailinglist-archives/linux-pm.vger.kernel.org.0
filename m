Indeed I did suggest it for the cover letter, sorry for my confusion
at not finding it in the commit log.

I actually think we need something in the patch commit log itself,
since the cover letter doesn't make it into git.

And probably a comment in the code as well, since this seems to change
the requirements on the callers of pci_host_probe().

I'm sure that you looked at the following paths through
pci_host_common_probe(), which as far as I can tell, do not call
pm_runtime_enable() before pci_host_probe():

  apple_pcie_probe
    pci_host_common_probe
      pci_host_probe

  mc_host_probe
    pci_host_common_probe
      pci_host_probe

And the following use pci_host_common_probe() directly as their
.probe() method:

  gen_pci_driver in pci-host-common.c
  thunder_ecam_driver in pci-thunder-ecam.c
  thunder_pem_driver in pci-thunder-pem.c
  hisi_pcie_almost_ecam_driver in dwc/pcie-hisi.c
  
Are all these safe as well?  These all end up in pci_host_probe()
without having done anything to enable runtime PM on the
PCIe controller platform_device.

Looking at your diagram above, IIUC this patch enables runtime PM for
the PCIe host bridge, and the requirement is that runtime PM is
already enabled for the PCIe controller above it?

Is it always *possible* for that PCIe controller to enable runtime PM?
Might there exist PCIe controllers that cannot enable runtime PM
because they lack something in hardware or in the driver?

Maybe this patch should only enable runtime PM for the host bridge if
the controller already has runtime PM enabled?

I would like to have a one-sentence statement of what the callers need
to do, including the actual function names.  Otherwise it's a pretty
big burden on reviewers to verify things.
