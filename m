Thank you for detailed information about i2c NAK. In this case try to
consider if it would not be better to add retry logic in the
bq27xxx_battery_i2c_read() function.

If it is common that bq chipset itself returns i2c NAKs during normal
operations then this affects any i2c read operation done by
bq27xxx_battery_i2c_read() function.

So this issue is not related just to reading "flags", but to anything.
That is why I think that retry should be handled at lower layer.
