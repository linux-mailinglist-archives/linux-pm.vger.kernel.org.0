Is this a hardware erratum?  If not, and this is working as designed,
it sounds like we'd need to apply this quirk to every device that
supports PTM.  That's not really practical.

The bugzilla says "there is no erratum as this does not affect
Windows," but that doesn't answer the question.  What I want to know
is whether this is a *hardware* defect and whether it will be fixed in
future hardware.

If it's a "wont-fix" hardware issue, we can just disable PTM
completely on Intel hardware and we won't have to worry about it
during suspend.
