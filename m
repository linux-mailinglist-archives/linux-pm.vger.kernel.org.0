Thanks (bookmarked). I'll read it before reviewing +1 version.

Requiring a config flag is something that slows down adoption in the
stock kernels.

Since we are talking about hibernate the decision whether to have this
feature set, does not have to be something that needs to be changed
dynamically to a running system.

So: maybe the best compromise would be to have it kernel command line
option? That way it's easier feature to adapt (e.g. with GRUB
configuration) and to enable in the kernel.
