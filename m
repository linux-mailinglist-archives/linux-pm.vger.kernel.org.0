OK, so without the $subject patch we (1) program the downstream
component (GPU) into D3hot, then we (2) program the port holding it
into D3hot and then we (3) let the AML (_OFF for the power resource
listed by _PR3 under the port object) run.

Something strange happens at this point (and I guess that _OFF doesn't
even reach the point where it removes power from the port which is why
we see a lock-up).

We know that skipping (1) makes things work and we kind of suspect
that skipping (3) would make things work either, but what about doing
(1) and (3) without (2)?

Well, that's the expected behavior, but the observed behavior isn't as
expected. :-)

That would be my guess.

Not really if D-states are involved.

Well, at least this is kind of out of the spec.

Note that pci_pm_suspend_noirq() won't let the port go into D3 if the
downstream device is in D0, so the $subject patch will not work as
expected in the suspend-to-idle case.

Also we really should make up our minds on whether or not to force
PCIe ports to stay in D0 when downstream devices are in D0 and be
consequent about that.  Right now we do one thing during system-wide
suspend and the other one in PM-runtime, which is confusing.

The current design is mostly based on the PCI PM Spec 1.2, so it would
be consequent to follow system-wide suspend in PM-runtime and avoid
putting PCIe ports holding devices in D0 into any low-power states.
but that would make the approach in the $subject patch ineffective.

Moreover, the fact that there are separate branches for "Windows 7"
and "Windows 8+" kind of suggest a change in the expected behavior
between Windows 7 and Windows 8, from the AML perspective.  I would
guess that Windows 7 followed PCI PM 1.2 and Windows 8 (and later)
does something else.  Now, the structure of the "Windows 8+" branch
described by you suggests that, at least in the cases when it is going
to remove power from the port eventually, it goes straight for the
link preparation (the L2/L3 Ready transition) and power removal
without bothering to program the downstream device and port into D3hot
(because that's kind of redundant).

That hypothetical "Windows 8+" approach may really work universally,
because it doesn't seem to break any rules (going straight from D0 to
D3cold is not disallowed and doing that for both a port and a
downstream device at the same time is kind of OK either, as long as
the link is ready for that).
