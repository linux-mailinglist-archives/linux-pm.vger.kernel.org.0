Yes, it is done on purpose as it is the commit bringing the feature. I 
thought it is convenient for the developer to read the description of 
the commit introducing the feature.

No actually it is plural.

struct threshold;
struct thresholds;

> Besides, why is the wrapper struct needed?

Because I think the threshold will continue to evolve. So instead of 
dealing with lists, we use a dedicated structure. In case we add new 
fields or we change the list by something else the functions prototypes 
are untouched. It is my way of coding in order to always set the scene 
for future changes.

It is unlikely to happen.

When the thermal zone is created and enabled, it updates the temperature 
of the thermal zone so tz->temperature is no longer THERMAL_TEMP_INVALID.

At this step, there is no userspace set yet.

Assuming there is zero update until we create a threshold. When this one 
is created then the thermal zone is updated, the temperature is read, 
the tz->last_temperature = tz->temperature and tz->temperature has the 
new value. Then handle_thresholds is called and finally set_trips

If the temperature is above or below a threshold then it is detected and 
notified because tz->last_temperature is not equal to THERMAL_TEMP_INVALID.

Others situations are IMO resulting from a bogus driver/sensor and 
should be handled at the sensor level, not the core code.

I can change that to list directly but if we add anything (which can 
probably happen) then the API change as well as anything below again.

I was expecting this comment :)

We have the choice between :
  * we do nothing
  * we return an error

Let's assume the userspace is misbehaving and because of an internal bug 
of a thermal engine it creates multiple times the same threshold (eg. 
index not incremented, etc ...). If the kernel reports nothing, then the 
user space will never detect this problem. If it reports the error the 
user space can choose to ignore it or follow it up.

The kernel is strict and it is up to the user space to ignore it or not.
