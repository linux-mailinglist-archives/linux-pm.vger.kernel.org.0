Thank you! So, just to be clear: in lieu of Lukas Wunner's reply, do you still want `lspci` and `dmesg` outputs, or are you okay with the information Lukas provided?

And while on it, an unrelated question to you as a maintainer: I never contributed to the kernel before: in case you are okay with the patch, what happens now that I got R-b, should I resend a v2 of it with the R-b added?
