Hi Linus,

Thank you for your review / insights
and sorry for the quite slow reply.

I agree with almost everything you've said and
I'll implement the suggested changes for v3
of this patch-series.

The story here is that as a hobby project I'm doing hw-enablement work
on some somewhat older x86_64 tablets. Some of which have these not
quite a fuel-gauge fuel-gauge chips which from using Linux's POV are
mostly just glorified ADCs.

I have no datasheets for either the fuel-gauge or the batteries used.

The below table is generic in the sense that I just took a generic
table from the internet and went with that.

For the next version these tables will be gone from the driver,
instead the driver now expects there to be at least a
"ocv-capacity-table-0" device-property with the table.

Ack, for v3 I'm switching to using power_supply_batinfo_ocv2cap()
replacing the custom table + mapping.

Right, so without a datasheet (and also note that these batteries
are old and have already seen quite a few cycles) we don't really
have per temperature ocv to capacity mappings table. Also there
is no temperature measurement of the actually battery cells
themselves here. So the new version just calls
power_supply_batinfo_ocv2cap() with a hardcoded temperature of
25Â° Celsius.

Which is fine since there will only be one ocv->capicity table
anyways since we lack a datasheet with this info.

Ack, as mentioned already the upcoming v3 has switched to
power_supply_batinfo_ocv2cap() and all this code is gone now.

I have neither a temperature sensor for the cells; nor
temperature variation curves.

As far as I can deduce from the Android kernel code there only
is support for measuring the PMIC ICs own temperature.

Anyways without temperature variation curves this does not matter.

Right, that is the nice way of doing things when doing
a new design and with datasheets in hand.

This code is for reverse-engineered battery support on somewhat
older tablets. Even if we had temperature variation curves,
I'm pretty sure that the battery cells are old enough those
will likely not be super accurate anymore.

Since the internal-resistance is calculated as discussed
below using uOhms would just give a false pretense of
precision IMHO.

This does not trigger often. I expect this happens when
the current makes a big jump during the sample window
for measuring voltage and current.

Ack, this is all done for the upcoming v3.

Right the issue is there is no datasheet, so no idea.
