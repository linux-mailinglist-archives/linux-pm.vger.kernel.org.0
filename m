It always is a PCIe port, but its location within the SoC may matter.

Also some custom AML-based power management is involved and that may
be making specific assumptions on the configuration of the SoC and the
GPU at the time of its invocation which unfortunately are not known to
us.

However, it looks like the AML invoked to power down the GPU from
acpi_pci_set_power_state() gets confused if it is not in PCI D0 at
that point, so it looks like that AML tries to access device memory on
the GPU (beyond the PCI config space) or similar which is not
accessible in PCI power states below D0.
