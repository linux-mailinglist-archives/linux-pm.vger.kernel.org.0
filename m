The result of this change in the suspend-to-idle path will be leaving
the device and its PCIe port in D0 while suspended, unless the device
itself has power management methods in the ACPI tables (according to
Mika that is not the case).

I don't think that this is desirable.

This is inaccurate and not entirely fair AFAICS.

First off, what is a "PCIe bridge controller"?  A PCIe root complex?

Second, I don't think that you really can blame hardware here, because
the problem is related to AML (forcing a different code path in AML
makes it go away, so the same hardware with different AML would work).

More precisely, the behavior of the kernel is not what is expected by
AML associated with the PCIe port holding the device.

Yes, but the change would need to cover both the PM-runtime and
suspend-to-idle code paths.

Also it may be driver-induced rather than quirk-based.

Which AML code is this, the power-off part or power-on part?  Is this
AML code associated with the GPU or with the PCIe port holding it (I
guess the latter from what Mika said)?

Also IIRC ACPICA has a mechanism to break infinite loops in AML by
aborting the looping method after a timeout.

IMO it would be enough to say that the GPU is not accessible after an
attempt to remove power from it.

Which ACPI code?

0x248 relative to what?  A PCI bar (if so then which one) or the PCI
config space (and which part of it if so)?

This doesn't seem accurate.  It rather writes to this register to
change the state of the PCIe link between the GPU and the PCIe port
holding it, which is not the same as powering off.

The meaning of the above is unclear.

Does "other" mean "alternative"?

A pointer to that documentation, please (yes, it should be included in
the comment).

So again, this is AML-related, so talking about hardware bugs at this
point is premature at best.

Based of what has been uncovered so far, I would propose the following
way to address this issue:

(1) Introduce a "parent_d3cold" PCI device flag that would indicate to
the PCI layer to leave the given device in D0 during suspend (both
system-wide and runtime) and power-manage the parent instead as long
as the parent PCIe port can be put into D3cold via ACPI (and as long
as the downstream device itself has no ACPI PM).
(2) Set this new flag for the GPUs in question from the nouveau driver.

So what about this?
