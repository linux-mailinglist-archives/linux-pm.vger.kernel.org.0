You need to be careful here because otherwise you end up situation where
the link is not properly trained and we tear down the whole tree of
devices which is worse than waiting bit more for resume.

Which system this is? ICL? I think it is the TBT root ports only that do
not support active link reporting. The PCIe spec is not entirely clear
about root ports since it explictly mentions only downstream ports so
one option would be to check for root port and that it supports gen 3
speeds and based on that wait for max say 2 * 100ms or something like
that.
