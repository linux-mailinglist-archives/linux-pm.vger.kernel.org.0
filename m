This doesn't explain anything to me, sorry.

Because it causes the system to use less energy when suspended.

And it is still unclear to me what the problem with it is.

I understand the wear-out concern.

Sorry, but not really.

Where do the above requirements come from?

I'm not sure what you mean by the "Android usecase" TBH.  Do you mean
the wear-out concern in the Android usage scenario or is there more to
it?
