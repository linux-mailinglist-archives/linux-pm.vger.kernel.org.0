That's because the device itself cannot be programmed into D3cold, so
the target state cannot be D3cold for it.

The specs aren't very clear in this area, though.

The overall picture is that the device in question is connected to a
port (a root port in this particular case) that can be programmed into
D3cold via ACPI, but the endpoint itself can only be programmed into
D3hot.  However, if the port goes into D3cold, the endpoint also goes
into D3cold (actually, my understanding of the specs is that even if
the port goes into D3hot, the endpoint should still be assumed to go
into D3cold).

The power state of the endpoint is changed first and at the time this
happens it is not known which power state the port is going to be
programmed into.

Now, the device is wake-capable (in general) and so we want it to be
able to signal wakeup from the final power state.  Because it only
reports PME support in D0 and in D3cold, the kernel today leaves it in
D0 which causes the port to stay in D0 too.  Still, putting the device
into D3hot allows the port to go into D3cold which in turn causes the
device to go into D3cold and it can signal wakeup from that state.

So there are two ways to get into a configuration from which the
endpoint device can signal wakeup, either by leaving it and the port
holding it both in D0, or by putting it into D3hot, so that the port
can go into D3cold in which case the endpoint will end up in D3cold.

The Mika's patch is aiming at enabling the second option.

> It also seems unfortunate to have to add this special case in two places.

That's because __pci_enable_wake() tries to be extra careful and only
call pci_pme_active() if PME is known to be supported in the target
power state, but that is not strictly necessary.  It could just call
pci_pme_active() unconditionally and return the
platform_pci_set_wakeup() return value.

I think I'll send a patch making this change.

Not really.

We put the device indo D3hot, because it will enable its parent port
to go into D3cold and that will cause the device itself to end up in
D3cold.

It looks now like the parent's capability to go into D3cold should be
checked here.

Good point.

That would be cleaner.
