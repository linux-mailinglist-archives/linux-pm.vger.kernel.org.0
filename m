Yes.  All of your comments above are correct.

Right.

It's slightly different:

  - For devices with no driver or a driver without PM, the state restored
    on "thaw" and "restore" will be the state from "freeze" instead of the
    state on probe.

So the same problem that we have for drivers using legacy PM, we also
have for devices with no driver or a driver without (modern) PM callbacks,
but only in the "freeze" codepath (for hibernation).

In the patch, I made the "pci_dev->state_saved = false" assignment
conditional on !pm_runtime_suspended() in the "freeze" codepath.
I didn't do the same in the legacy codepath because none of the
drivers using legacy PM callbacks seem to be using runtime PM.

The purpose of making it conditional on !pm_runtime_suspended()
is just that we'd otherwise call pci_save_state() twice:  Once in
pci_pm_runtime_suspend() and once more in pci_pm_freeze().
That would be pointless.

In the commit message, I provided a rationale for the conditionality,
but inadvertently caused confusion.

I'd suggest instead (feel free to wordsmith as you see fit):

  Restore the suspend config state, not the state from probe or error
  recovery, for drivers using legacy PCI suspend.   [ <- unmodified ]

  Same for devices with no driver or a driver without PM callbacks
  when the system is hibernated.                   [ <- replacement ]

Mentioning the runtime PM conditionality in the high-level changelog
is probably not worth it.

Was I able to clarify all questions?  Please ask again if not.

Also, in case the meaning of "freeze", "thaw", "restore" isn't clear,
here's the order of a hibernation sequence (suspend to disk):

  pci_pm_prepare()
  pci_pm_freeze()
  pci_pm_freeze_noirq()
  <system image is generated>
  pci_pm_thaw_noirq()
  pci_pm_thaw()
  pci_pm_complete()
  pci_pm_prepare()
  pci_pm_poweroff()
  pci_pm_poweroff_late()
  pci_pm_poweroff_noirq()
  <system is asleep, then restarted with boot kernel>
  pci_pm_prepare()
  pci_pm_freeze()
  pci_pm_freeze_noirq()
  <system image is restored, replacing the boot kernel>
  pci_pm_restore_noirq()
  pci_pm_restore()
  pci_pm_complete()

Note that "freeze" happens twice in the whole sequence.

Thanks,

Lukas
