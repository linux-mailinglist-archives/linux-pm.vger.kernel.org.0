I understand that but there is the 'switch_on_temp' trip point which is
supposed to begin to collect the power values ahead of the
'desired_temp' (aka mitigation trip point / sustainable power).

The change I proposed is correct then no ? The polling is still effective.

If the IPA needs a sampling, it may be more adequate to separate the
sampling from the polling. So the other governors won't be impacted by
the IPA specific setup, and we do not end up with polling/passive delays
tricks for a governor. The IPA would have its own self-encapsulated
sampling rate and the thermal zone setup won't depend on the governor.

What do you think ?
