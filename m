Yes, it does, for power states deeper than D0, which is not the case here.

The main difference is the dev->current_state == state check in
pci_set_power_state(), but in the resume case specifically
dev->current_state == PCI_D0 doesn't matter, because the real power
state of the device may be different.

It means "go into D0 no matter what the current cached value is".

For transitions into D0 __pci_start_power_transition() is the platform
stuff, so we don't skip it and the other things that are present in
pci_set_power_state() and are not there in pci_power_up() are simply
unnecessary for transitions to D0.

It kind of is, but I'd prefer to do it on top of this patch.

First, the pci_update_current_state() in pci_power_up() can be moved
to pci_pm_default_resume_early() which is the only caller of
pci_power_up(). [The role of that pci_update_current_state() is to
change the current_state value to D3cold if the device is not
accessible (or the platform firmware says that it is D3cold, which may
be the case after a failing attempt to use it to switch the device
over to D0).]  Next, if pci_power_up() is modified to return the
return value of pci_raw_set_power_state(), pci_set_power_state() can
be implemented (roughly) as

sanitize the state argument

if (dev->current_state == state)
        return 0;

if (state == PCI_D0)
        return pci_power_up();

carry out a transition into a deeper power state.

And so pci_power_up() will be used by pci_set_power_state(), for
transitions into D0, and (directly) by pci_pm_default_resume_early().

How does that sound?

I will, thanks!
