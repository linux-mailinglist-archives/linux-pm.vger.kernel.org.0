My objection was that the original patch is a quirk that applies only
to Intel devices.

If this is a generic thing that should be done for *all* devices that
support PTM, that's fine, but it should not be a quirk, and it should
not involve a list of Vendor or Device IDs.

Yup, looks like a mistake.  Maybe David can fix that at the same time
(probably a separate patch, though).  I don't have a way to test it,
but he probably does.

My questions were all prompted by the Intel-specific nature of the
original patch, which suggests an ongoing maintenance burden.  If it
can be done generically, I have no problem with it.
