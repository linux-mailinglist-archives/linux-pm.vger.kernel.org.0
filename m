"Not the end of the world" as in the model making incorrect assumptions.
With the significant power-performance overlaps we see in mobile systems
taking sugov's guess while using powersave/performance (the !setpolicy
case) at least will make worse decisions.
See here for reference, first slide.

What about the config space, are you fine with everything relying on
CONFIG_CPU_FREQ_GOV_SCHEDUTIL?
