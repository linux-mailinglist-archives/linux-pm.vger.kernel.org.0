Yes, that's what I wanted to say, sorry for the confusion.

IIRC, there are two reasons why the NVMe driver does this:
(1) On some platforms the devices handled by it couldn't come back
from D3cold without platform firmware's help.
(2) Putting devices into D3hot alone was not sufficient to reduce
their power sufficiently and it didn't make much difference on top of
the other things done to them for this purpose.

 It avoids putting devices into D3cold (or even into D3hot for that
matter) because of the above, not because it is generally required to
do so in suspend-to-idle.  So this really is exceptional behavior and
not following a rule of some kind.

OK, now all of this makes sense and that's why you really want NVMe
devices to end up in some form of PCI D3 in suspend-to-idle.

Would D3hot be sufficient for this platform or does it need to be
D3cold?  If the latter, what exactly is the method by which they are
put into D3cold?

OK

I think we're getting to the bottom of the issue.

First off, there really is no requirement to avoid putting PCI devices
into D3hot or D3cold during suspend-to-idle.  On all modern Intel
platforms, PCIe devices are put into D3(hot or cold) during
suspend-to-idle and I don't see why this should be any different on
platforms from any other vendors.

The NVMe driver is an exception and it avoids D3(hot or cold) during
suspend-to-idle because of problems with some hardware or platforms.
It might in principle allow devices to go into D3(hot or cold) during
suspend-to-idle, so long as it knows that this is going to work.

However, there is an additional concern that putting an NVMe device
into D3cold every time during system suspend on Android might cause it
to wear out more quickly.

Is there anything else?
