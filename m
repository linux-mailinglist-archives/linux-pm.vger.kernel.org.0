I don't see that happening in the AML though.

Basically the difference is that when Windows 7 or Linux (the _REV==5
check) then we directly do link disable whereas in Windows 8+ we invoke
LKDS() method that puts the link into L2/L3. None of the fields they
access seem to touch the GPU itself.

LKDS() for the first PEG port looks like this:

   P0L2 = One
   Sleep (0x10)
   Local0 = Zero
   While (P0L2)
   {
	If ((Local0 > 0x04))
	{
	    Break
	}

	Sleep (0x10)
	Local0++
   }

One thing that comes to mind is that the loop can end even if P0L2 is
not cleared as it does only 5 iterations with 16 ms sleep between. Maybe
Sleep() is implemented differently in Windows? I mean Linux may be
"faster" here and return prematurely and if we leave the port into D0
this does not happen, or something. I'm just throwing out ideas :)
