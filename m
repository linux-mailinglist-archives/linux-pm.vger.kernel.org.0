With some free time I was able to find a system in our lab that reproduces =
the
same failure reported on the last problem report from Thomas. That is, with
powersave selected, the nvme fails to come up after resume from S3 with thi=
s
patch without a quirk. It's actually obvious when you can see the flow. We
observed that on S3 resume, BIOS has enabled L1.2 (likely back to preboot
setting). Restoring powersave will therefore disable L1.2. Per spec, L1.2 m=
ust
be disabled on the downstream first. But pci_restore_state() gets called on
upstream devices first. Indeed, on my system, clearing the L1.2 state on th=
e
root port makes the nvme device inaccessible by the time
pci_aspm_restore_state() is called for it. I've modified the patch to defer=
 L1SS
restore until the downstream component so they can be done together. The pa=
tch
clears L1.2 on the child first before the parent, restores both configs and=
 then
reenables them in reverse on the parent then the child. This works on my sy=
stem.
I've posted the patch as a V5 and on the bugzilla and appreciate if anyone =
here
can test.
