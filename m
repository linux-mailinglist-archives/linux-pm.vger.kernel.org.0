Don't know what the exact symptoms of the original problem are.
I'd more see a certain risk that this change reveals bugs in RPM usage
of PCI device drivers. There's not a fixed list of potential symptoms.

One example: igb driver caused a hang on system shutdown when RPM was
enabled due to a RTNL deadlock in RPM resume path.

For each device in sysfs: power/control: "auto" -> "on"
