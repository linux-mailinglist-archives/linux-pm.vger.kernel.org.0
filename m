Firstly, please note that "you" is not appropriate here. This is James'
commit message, not mine.

> done by cpu_dev_register_generic()? Is the work means register the cpu?

When ACPI is disabled _and_ CONFIG_GENERIC_CPU_DEVICES is enabled, then
cpu_dev_register_generic() will call arch_register_cpu() for each present
CPU after this commit, rather than for each _possible_ CPU (which is the
actual code change here.)

This is what happens later in the series.

"drivers: base: Allow parts of GENERIC_CPU_DEVICES to be overridden"
adds a test for CONFIG_GENERIC_CPU_DEVICES, so this will only be used
with architectures using GENERIC_CPU_DEVICES. Then in:

"ACPI: processor: Register all CPUs from acpi_processor_get_info()"
which is not part of this series, this adds a call to arch_register_cpu()
in the ACPI code, and disables this path via a test for !acpi_disabled.

Essentially, this path gets used to register the present CPUs when
firmware (ACPI) isn't going to be registering the present CPUs.

I've changed this to:

"It makes very little sense to register all possible CPUs. Registering
a CPU is what triggers the udev notifications allowing user-space to
react to newly added CPUs.

"To allow all five ACPI architectures to use GENERIC_CPU_DEVICES, change
it to use for_each_present_cpu().

"Making the ACPI architectures use GENERIC_CPU_DEVICES is a pre-requisite
step to centralise their register_cpu() logic, before moving it into the
ACPI processor driver. When we add support for register CPUs from ACPI
in a later patch, we will avoid registering CPUs in this path."

which I hope makes it clearer.

Thanks, I'll fix that.
