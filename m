Ideally, if we can close the performance gap and have only one
version, then that would be the best :)

Problem with making it optional, or maintaining effectively two swap
implementations, is that it will make the patch series unreadable and
unreviewable, and the code base unmaintanable :) You'll have x2 the
amount of code to reason about and test, much more merge conflicts at
rebase and cherry-pick time. And any improvement to one version takes
extra work to graft onto the other version.

There's nothing wrong with that ;)

I like the swap table format (and your cluster-based swap allocator) a
lot. This patch series does not aim to remove that design - I just
want to separate the address space of physical and virtual swaps to
enable new use cases...

I mean, it is a real production issue :) We have a variety of server
machines and services. Each of the former has its own memory and drive
size. Each of the latter has its own access characteristics,
compressibility, latency tolerance (and hence would prefer a different
swapping solutions - zswap, disk swap, zswap x disk swap). Coupled
with the fact that now multiple services can cooccur on one host, and
one services can be deployed on different kinds of hosts, statically
sizing the swapfile becomes operationally impossible and leaves a lot
of wins on the table. So swap space has to be dynamic.

By "dynamic growth of swap files", do you mean dynamically adjusting
the size of the swapfile? then that capacity does not exist right now,
and I don't see a good design laid out for it... At the very least,
the swap allocator needs to be dynamic in nature. I assume it's going
to look something very similar to vswap's current attempt, which
relies on a tree structure (radix tree i.e xarray). Sounds familiar?
;)

I feel like each of the problem I mention in this cover letter can be
solved partially with some amount of hacks, but none of them will
solve it all. And once you slaps all the hacks together, you just get
virtual swap, potentially shoved within specific backend codebase
(zswap or zram). That's not... ideal.

I don't understand your point regarding the "reading everything into
swap cache". Yes, you can do that, but you would still lock the swap
device in place, because the page table entries still refer to slots
on the physical swap device - you cannot free the swap device, nor
space on disk, not even the swapfile's metadata (especially since the
swap cache is now intertwined with the physical swap layer).

Yeah this was based on 6.19, which did not have your swap cache change yet =
:)

I have taken a look at your latest swap table work in mm-stable, and I
think most of that can conceptually incorporated in to this line of
work as well.

Chiefly, the new swap cache synchronization scheme (i.e whoever puts
the folio in swap cache first gets exclusive rights) still works in
virtual swap world (and hence, the removal of swap cache pin, which is
one bit in the virtual swap descriptor).

Similarly, do you think we cannot hold the folio lock in place of the
cluster lock in the virtual swap world? Same for a lot of the memory
overhead reduction tricks (such as using shadow for cgroup id instead
of a separate swap_cgroup unsigned short field). I think comparing the
two this way is a bit apples-to-oranges (especially given the new
features enabled by vswap).

Side note - I might have missed this. If it's still ongoing, would
love to help debug this :)

Ah yeah that too. I neglected to mention this, but with vswap you can
merge several swap operations in zswap code path and no longer have to
release-then-reacquire the swap locks, since zswap entries live in the
same lock scope as swap cache entries.

It's more of a side note either way, because my main goal with this
patch series is to enable new features. Getting a performance win is
always nice of course :)

Do you mean using memory to the point where it triggered the global waterma=

Hmm this one I don't think I can reproduce without your laptop ;)

Jokes aside, I did try to run the kernel build with disk swapping, and
the performance is on par with baseline. Swap performance with NVME
swap tends to be dominated by IO work in my experiments. Do you think
I missed something here? Maybe it's the concurrency difference (since
I always run with -j$(nproc), i.e the number of workers =3D=3D the number
of processors).

I'll see if I can reproduce the issues! I'll start with usemem one
first, as that seems easier to reproduce...
