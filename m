Earlier I asked about how we can verify that no other drivers need a
change like the starfive one:
https://lore.kernel.org/r/20241012140852.GA603197@bhelgaas

I guess this sentence is basically how we verify all drivers are safe
with this change?  

Since this patch adds devm_pm_runtime_enable() in pci_host_probe(),
can we expand this along the lines of this so it's more specific about
what we need to verify?

  Every host bridge driver must call pm_runtime_enable() before
  runtime PM is enabled by pci_host_probe().

Please correct me if that's not the right requirement.
