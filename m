I ran some tests with the teo governor enabled, but it didnâ€™t make a
lot of difference. The results are presented below.

Yes, that's right ideally this condition should have prevented this,
but `data->next_timer_ns` is almost always greater than the actual
idle duration which seems inaccurate.

I ran some experiments based on your suggestions. Below are the
relative average runtimes and percentage differences compared to
the base version:

Picked a single representative workload for simplicity:

Note: Lower (% Difference) the better.
|---------------------------|-----------------|--------------|
| Configuration             | Average Runtime | % Difference |
|---------------------------|-----------------|--------------|
| Base (menu)               | 1.00            | 0.00%        |
| Base + Patch 1 (menu)     | 0.92            | -8.00%       |
| Base + Patch 2 (menu)     | 0.98            | -2.00%       |
| Base (teo)                | 1.01            | +1.00%       |
|---------------------------|-----------------|--------------|
Patch 1: https://lore.kernel.org/all/20240809073120.250974-2-aboorvad@linux.ibm.com/Â  
Patch 2: https://lore.kernel.org/all/c20a07e4-b9e6-4a66-80f5-63d679b17c3b@arm.com/

It seems that Patch 2 does provide a slight improvement in runtime, but
not significantly like Patch 1. Additionally, teo does not seem
to help in this case.

Regarding the condition `s->target_residency_ns <= data->next_timer_ns`,
it appears that `data->next_timer_ns` is consistently greater than
both actual idle duration and `s->target_residency_ns` so this condition
nearly always holds true, indicating some inaccuracy. I'll investigate
this further and follow up with more details.

Regards,
Aboorva
