Per section 3.1.2 of Documentation/power/pci.rst, pci_save_state()
may be called by either the driver or the PCI core.  Normally it's
the PCI core's responsibility, but a driver may choose to call it
and bring the device into a low power state itself.  The PCI core
recognizes that by looking at the state_saved flag in struct pci_dev
and will then neither call pci_save_state() nor transition the device
to a low power state.  That is the (only) purpose of the flag.

I could maybe add a cross-reference pointing to Documentation/power/pci.rst.
And/or that document could be moved to Documentation/PCI/.

Basically the answer is, it should never happen and if it does,
we've got a bug somewhere.

My (limited) understanding is that you may end up with a bad
saved state on s390 virtualization scenarios because you're
telling the PCI core in the ->error_detected phase() that the
device has recovered and then you try to reset and recover the
device on your own.  I think the solution is to enhance qemu
to integrate better with error recovery on the host.

Thanks,

Lukas
