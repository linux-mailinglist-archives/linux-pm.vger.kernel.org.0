Hi Steev,

That's interesting what you've done with Rockchip RK3399.
I would like to reproduce your experiment on my RockPI 4B v1.3.
Could you tell me how you to add this boost frequency that you have
mentioned in some previous emails?

I want to have similar setup to yours and I'll check all the subsystems
involved in the decision making process for triggering this boost freq.

Thanks for the pointers, I'll give it a try when I sort out this
Rockchip boost setup.

Thank you for your support.
