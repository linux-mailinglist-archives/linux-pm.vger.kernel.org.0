Okay, in both cases the refcount underflow occurs on a PCIe port.
So it seems likely the gratuitous refcount decrement is in portdrv.c
or one of the port services drivers.

Your patch changes the code path for *all* PCI devices.
Not just PCIe ports.  Hence it's likely not the right fix.

It may fix the issue on this particular PCIe port but
I strongly suspect it'll leak a runtime PM ref on all other devices.

Could you please answer this?

The drop to 0 is uninteresting.  You need to record *all*
refcount increments/decrements so that we can see where the
gratuitous one occurs.  It happens earlier than the drop to 0.

However, please first check whether the pci_bridge_d3_possible()
return value changes on probe versus remove of the PCIe port
in question.  If it does, then that's the root cause and there's
no need to look any further.

Thanks,

Lukas
