Does upstream DTS have support for this platform to understand it better ?
Even reference to any complete DT file for the platform will help.

Does the platform have system timers ? What are the deeper idle states ?
If it is retention state with local timers on, I doubt if my suspicion of
CPU acting as broadcast timer in absence of a better/system timer.

Yes my suspicion seems correct now but I can't confirm unless I understand
the platform completely.

Interesting. So if the platform is functional removing local-timer-stop,
I am bit confused. Either there is something else that is getting it out
from the idle state so, it should be fine and it could be just some
misconfiguration.

Some systems have system timer that can take over as broadcast timer when
CPUs enter deeper idle states where the local timers are stopped.
