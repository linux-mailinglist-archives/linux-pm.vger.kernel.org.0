Nit, add a blank line here.

This is more a comment on the existing code than on this particular
patch, but I find this whole function hard to understand, and I think
one reason is that there are a lot of negative conditions, both in
this function and in its callers.  This "target_state != ... &&
target_state != ...  && current_state != ..." is one example.  Another
is the function name itself.  It might be easier to read as something
like this:

  bool pci_dev_need_resume(...)
  {
    if (!pm_runtime_suspended(...))
      return true;

    if (platform_pci_need_resume(...))
      return true;

    if (target_state != current_state)
      return true;

    ...

Another reason I think it's hard to read is that
"pci_dev_keep_suspended" suggests that this is a pure boolean function
without side-effects, but in fact it also fiddles with the PME state
in some cases.  I don't have any ideas for that part.
