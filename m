OK

Does this involve any AML, like a _PS3 under the GPU object?

Which AML do you mean, specifically?  The _OFF method for the root
port's _PR3 power resource or something else?

So that may be where the problem is.

Putting the downstream component into PCI D[1-3] is expected to put
the link into L1, so I'm not sure how that plays with the later
attempt to put it into L2/L3 Ready.

Also, L2/L3 Ready is expected to be transient, so finally power should
be removed somehow.

But this actually works for the downstream component in D0, doesn't it?

Also, if the downstream component is in D0, the port actually should
stay in D0 too, so what would happen with the $subject patch applied?
