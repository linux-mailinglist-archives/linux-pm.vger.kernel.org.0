May be a critical trip point? (but a monitoring delay will be needed 
implying additional wake ups if the interrupt mode is not supported)

If you put an active or passive trip point without a cooling device, 
that trip point won't do anything except sending a notification to the 
userspace when it is crossed (if monitored).

It is always useful to have a passive trip, so when the writable trip 
option is enabled, the userspace can set the temperature and get notified.

I don't know but the thermal framework does not support the cold trip 
points (yet). That means here, the battery will be in temperature 
violation if the temperature is above -50째C

Yeah, ACPI ...

Mine is:

acpi -tci
Thermal 0: ok, 16.8 degrees C
Thermal 0: trip point 0 switches to mode critical at temperature 20.8 
degrees C
Thermal 0: trip point 1 switches to mode hot at temperature 19.8 degrees C
Thermal 1: ok, 16.8 degrees C
Thermal 1: trip point 0 switches to mode critical at temperature 20.8 
degrees C
Thermal 1: trip point 1 switches to mode hot at temperature 19.8 degrees C

:)

IMO, you are reinventing the wheel in the battery code.

Why not use the cooling device psy_register_cooler()? And let the 
thermal framework deal with the monitoring and the mitigation ?

(cold trip point handling will have to stay in the current code)

Sure, no problem. May be see if that could be done more elegantly?

Ok
