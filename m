Do you have any other technical reason for this other than simplicity ?
We can't always have to so simple when managing to support wide variety
of platforms with standards like SCMI.

You need to justify why it is hard for the driver if there are 2 genpd
domains associated with a device(power and perf genpds).

This is purely software implementation and expect no change in the firmware
(DT) representation of these domains and association with the device.

Not possible unless the specification assures the power domain and the
performance domain IDs match.

+1, it was designed this way to ensure it addresses all the possible
implementations using SCMI.

NACK as I mentioned, we need to keep DT representation as minimal as
possible, adding nodes for this virtual domain is a no go IMO. Just
use the existing binding to create this virtual genpd at which point you
may realise handling 2 genpd in the driver may not be so hard ðŸ˜„.

Again big fat NACK as above. No change in the binding to make it confusing.

At this point I give up and will just say I would expect no change in the
DT bindings to achieve whatever you are terming as "simple" here. We are
not going to add any bindings to make it easy or simple for OS to implement
it's policy.

Not an OS issue. If the power domain is purely controlled by PSCI agent, why
is it even present to OS as SCMI power domain. We have examples where it
is correctly presented as PSCI power domain. So this issue doesn't exist,
fix the SCMI platform firmware. It needs to present per agent view correctly
and not present a global system view to all the agents.

Unless I hear strong technical reasons to this approach other than simplicity,
I am inclined towards opposing this proposal.
