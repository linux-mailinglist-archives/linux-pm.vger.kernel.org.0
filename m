In terms of PCI core, this is fine. But there's no attempt made at
checking that the platform state (not the core state) is compatible with
what we're setting here.

So the core state is correct and shows that the device is on, but
unfortunately there's some ACPI code out there that seems to initialize
some ACPI power resource to a state that doesn't match this (in this
case off). So updating the state without also making sure that the power
resource is also updated (e.g. turned on or at least marked as turned on
here) leaves both states to be different (emphasis on leaves, the were
already out-of-sync before that). E.g. in my case PCI says 'on'
(correct) and ACPI says 'off' (wrong).

The problem is that when we now later transition the device into D3cold,
the PCI core itself will do that transition just fine, but the PCI-ACPI
(i.e. platform) part thinks the power resource is already off and won't
do anything. And that prevents the device from actually being turned
off.

Also running pci_set_power_state(..., PCI_D0) later does not fix that
because the PCI core (correctly) believes that the device is already on
and just returns doing nothing. So it doesn't even attempt to check the
platform state, which is reasonable behavior if one assumes that the
platform state is always in sync with the PCI core state. It's just that
here, I think, we can't assume that they're in sync (mostly because ACPI
/ platform stuff may be weird and buggy and we may not have control over
that).

This is why I suggested replacing pci_set_power_state(dev, PCI_D0) with
pci_power_up(dev). With PCI_D0, they essentially do the same thing,
except for the (first) state check. Also both later call
pci_platform_power_transition() and pci_raw_set_power_state(), which
(should) have their individual state checks. So if the device is already
in D0, this boils down to calling the pci_platform_power_transition()
only.

Yes, that's pretty much it.

The problem I'm dealing with specifically is caused by the ACPI code in
[1]. There, _STA gets initialized to 'off' and is only updated when the
power transitions run (i.e. the _ON or _OFF methods). There's nothing in
this ACPI code that checks the actual state of the PCI device, which
causes this problem. So, to me, it seems that this code is expecting the
_ON method to be called in PCI bring-up.
