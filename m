Mostly things seem okay after your explanation, I think the only question=

mark is a driver calling pci_resize_resource() directly to resize BARs.

Fair enough, I didn't check what it does.

IMO, the details about how the usage count behaves should be part of the=20
changelog as that documentation I quoted sounded like user control is=20
prevented when forbidden. I see you've put this part of the explanation=20
into the v2 as well so I suggest you explain the usage count in the change=
=20
so it is recorded in the commit if somebody has to look at this commit=20
years from now.

Okay, seem fine for the PCI core part.

Driver's can also trigger BAR resize by calling pci_resize_resource()=20
directly but I've no idea how the usage counts behave (TBH, PM isn't my=20
strongest forte even if Lukas pulled me in to comment).

Okay, maybe it's fine like the rest. I was mostly trying to think=20
non-subsys_initcall() cases I knew of without contextualizing them back to=

this patch.

Ah yes, I think I was too attached to the "pairing" thought at that point=
=20
to see this isn't like e.g. a lock/unlock pair.
