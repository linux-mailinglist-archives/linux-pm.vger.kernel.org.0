Yes. We understand IPA could bring down the power/frequency cap multiple 
levels compared to step wise which is doing iteratively. With cooling 
device weights this makes IPA good for skin temperature control. But 
when we evaluated IPA, we found step wise is giving a better performance 
compared to IPA for localized junction temperature rules. Additionally, 
step wise for the junction temperature rule is easier to tune with fewer 
parameters. With these additional enhancements, step wise turned out to 
be a better choice for local junction temperature rules.
