Right, there's a long ugly history of this, here's the pcie_no_aspm()
comment:

  /*
   * Disabling ASPM is intended to prevent the kernel from modifying
   * existing hardware state, not to clear existing state. To that end:
   * (a) set policy to POLICY_DEFAULT in order to avoid changing state
   * (b) prevent userspace from changing policy
   */
  if (!aspm_force) {
	  aspm_policy = POLICY_DEFAULT;
	  aspm_disabled = 1;
  }

which came from 3c076351c402 ("PCI: Rework ASPM disable code").  All
the ASPM disable, force, support_enabled, policy, etc flags make this
ugly and impossible to read.  I guess renaming might help a little.

+10

Also the ugliness of pcie_aspm_init_link_state() being called
completely out of the usual enumeration flow.  And the parallel device
hierarchy maintained in struct pcie_link_state.  And config options to
set the default policy.  Ugh.

I hope we can avoid adding VMD-specific code in aspm.c.
