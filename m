I don't know what runpm is.  Some userspace utility?  Module
parameter?

Nice script, thanks for sharing it :)  I could learn a lot of useful
python by studying it.

You mention Nvidia GPUs above, but I guess the same issue may affect
other devices?  I would really like to chase this down to a more
specific issue, e.g., a hardware defect with erratum, an ACPI defect,
or a Linux defect.  Without the specifics, this is just a band-aid.

I don't see any relevant requirements in the _OFF description, but I
don't know much about ACPI power control.

Your script allows several scenarios; I *guess* the one that causes
the problem is:

  - write 3 (D3hot) to GPU PowerState (PCIE_PM_REG == 0x64, I assume
    PM Capability Control Register)
  - write 3 (D3hot) to bridge PowerState (0x84, I assume PM Capability
    Control Register)
  - run _OFF on the power resource for the bridge

From your script I assume you do:

  - run _ON on the power resource for the bridge
  - write 0 (D0) to the bridge PowerState

You do *not* write the GPU PowerState (which we can't do if the GPU is
in D3cold).  Is there some assumption that it comes out of D3cold via
some other mechanism, e.g., is the _ON supposed to wake up the GPU?

What exactly is the serious issue?  I guess it's that the rescan
doesn't detect the GPU, which means it's not responding to config
accesses?  Is there any timing component here, e.g., maybe we're
missing some delay like the ones Mika is adding to the reset paths?

If this ends up being a hardware defect, we should use a quirk to set
a bit in the pci_dev once, as we do for broken_intx_masking and
similar bits.
