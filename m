Sure, i will add them.

This patch places the speed and width in the host controller directory.
/sys/.../xxx.pcie/pcie_speed
/sys/.../xxx.pcie/pcie_width

I agree with you partially,  because i am having couple of points making 
me to
keep speed and width change entries in controller directory:

-- For changing the speed/width with device node, software ends up 
traversing to the controller
   from the device and do the operations.
-- Change speed and width are performed at controller level,
-- Keeping speed and width in controller gives a perspective (to the 
user) of changing
them only once irrespective of no. of devices.
-- For speed and link change in Synopsys PCIe controller, specific 
registers need to be configured.
    This prevents or complicates adding the speed and width change 
functionality in pci-sysfs or pci framework.

Dilip
