Applied to pci/pm for v6.20, thanks!  I tried to simplify the commit
log so the issue isn't hidden by details.  Happy to restore things if
I trimmed too much:

    PCI/PM: Prevent runtime suspend until devices are fully initialized

    Previously, it was possible for a PCI device to be runtime-suspended before
    it was fully initialized. When that happened, the suspend process could
    save invalid device state, for example, before BAR assignment. Restoring
    the invalid state during resume may leave the device non-functional.

    Prevent runtime suspend for PCI devices until they are fully initialized by
    deferring pm_runtime_enable().

    More details on how exactly this may occur:

      1. PCI device is created by pci_scan_slot() or similar

      2. As part of pci_scan_slot(), pci_pm_init() puts the device in D0 and
         prevents runtime suspend prevented via pm_runtime_forbid()

      3. pci_device_add() adds the underlying 'struct device' via device_add(),
         which means user space can allow runtime suspend, e.g.,

           echo auto > /sys/bus/pci/devices/.../power/control

      4. PCI device receives BAR configuration
         (pci_assign_unassigned_bus_resources(), etc.)

      5. pci_bus_add_device() applies final fixups, saves device state, and
         tries to attach a driver

    The device may potentially be suspended between #3 and #5, so this is racy
    with user space (udev or similar).

    Many PCI devices are enumerated at subsys_initcall time and so will not
    race with user space, but devices created later by hotplug or modular
    pwrctrl or host controller drivers are susceptible to this race.

    More runtime PM details at the first Link: below.
