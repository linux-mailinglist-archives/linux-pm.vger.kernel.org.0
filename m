I've been working with Thomas, whose system is the last known to have probl=
ems
with Mika's patch. It turns out that his config sets aspm_policy to 'powers=
ave'.
If he sets it to any other policy, Mika's patch works [1]. It's possible th=
at
others may see the same issue if they use 'powersave' as well.

The theory right now is that enabling L1SS in pci_restore_state() is too ea=
rly.
During boot, if ASPM policy is 'powersave' or 'powersupersave', ASPM enabli=
ng is
deferred. The comment in pcie_aspm_init_link_state() that skips it state th=
at:

        /*
         * At this stage drivers haven't had an opportunity to change the
         * link policy setting. Enabling ASPM on broken hardware can crippl=
e
         * it even before the driver has had a chance to disable ASPM, so
         * default to a safe level right now. If we're enabling ASPM beyond
         * the BIOS's expectation, we'll do so once pci_enable_device() is
         * called.
         */

While pci_enable_device() is called by the PCI core before pci_restore_stat=
e()
on resume, it is called again later by the nvme driver in nvme_pci_enable()=
.
This stage seems the intended intercept mentioned in the comment. This ends=
 up
calling pcie_aspm_powersave_config_link() to configure ASPM at that time. D=
uring
boot we see ASPM enabling is indeed happening for powersave during
nvme_pci_enable(). With the save/restore patch however it is being restored
before nvme_pci_enable(). I've asked Thomas not to apply Mika's patch, but
instead use a different patch [2] that waits until
pcie_aspm_powersave_config_link() is called to configure ASPM. The need for=
 this
is mentioned below. Hopefully it will fix the hang observed on his system.

Whether that patch works for him, we can address his problem with the curre=
nt
L1SS save/restore patch by removing the current denylist and instead only d=
o the
save/restore if ASPM policy is 'default' which doesn't hang his system. Thi=
s
makes sense since it's only the BIOS config that we care to preserve since =
it
can be lost during suspend, particularly during s2idle. All other policies =
are
OS controlled if allowed. Instead of save/restore for those we can let it b=
e
configured later when pcie_aspm_powersave_config_link() is called.

The only issue with this is that pcie_aspm_powersave_config_link() will not
configure ASPM if aspm_policy has not changed. This is a problem because we
observed that after resume from S3, BIOS has reenabled L1SS. So we can boot=
 with
powersave (which disables L1SS) but resume with L1SS enabled and policy sti=
ll
set to powersave. This is a preexisting bug. I've observed this behavior on
Thomas's system and with mainline on our desktop systems. This is the reaso=
n for
patch [2]. It will force ASPM to be configured in
pcie_aspm_powersave_config_link() even if the policy is the same. It works =
on my
system. I'm hoping that it will work on his system to resume successfully w=
ith
the correct policy enabled.
