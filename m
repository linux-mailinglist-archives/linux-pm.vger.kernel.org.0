I re-run the tests with the thermometer application that you indicated.

This is the conf I used:

thermal-zones = (
          {    name = "cpu-thermal";
        polling = 100; }
      )

The used device tree is as follows:

	thermal-zones {
		cpu_thermal: cpu-thermal {
			polling-delay-passive = <250>;
			polling-delay = <1000>;
			thermal-sensors = <&tsu>;
			sustainable-power = <423>;

			cooling-maps {
				map0 {
					trip = <&target>;
					cooling-device = <&cpu0 0 2>;
					contribution = <1024>;
				};
			};

			trips {
				sensor_crit: sensor-crit {
					temperature = <125000>;
					hysteresis = <1000>;
					type = "critical";
				};

				target: trip-point {
					temperature = <56000>;
					hysteresis = <1000>;
					type = "passive";
				};
			};
		};
	};

I executed with:

time ./thermometer -o out -l DEBUG -c t.conf -- ./test.sh

where test.sh is:

sleep 10; time echo 100000000 | dhry; sleep 10

My dhry has no -t or -r option so I passed the number of runs checking that
the test executes for 120 seconds.

I executed first the thermometer application with runtime PM suspend/resume
on temperature read, then wait for ~25 minutes then executed the tests w/o
runtime PM suspend/resume on temperature read.

The output of the thermometer application is as follows:

- runtime PM suspend/resume when reading: https://p.fr33tux.org/5bbb4d
- no runtime PM suspend/resumes when reading: https://p.fr33tux.org/c9a7cf
- full console log while testing: https://p.fr33tux.org/ace3a6

I also plotted the results for visual comparison as follows:

1/ RPM + no-RPM (continuous time base):
https://i2.paste.pics/c3956d15a7a889a9e1ee5b60529b42f6.png?rand=axUi4IsA1C

Please let me know how your input.
