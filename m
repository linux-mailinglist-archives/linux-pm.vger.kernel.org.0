Thanks for sharing the code, my initial idea after the discussion at
LSFMM is that there is a simple way to combine this with the "swap
table" [1] design of mine to solve the performance issue of this
series: just store the pointer of this struct in the swap table. It's
a bruteforce and glue like solution but the contention issue will be
gone.

Of course it's not a good approach, ideally the data structure can be
simplified to an entry type in the swap table. The swap table series
handles locking and synchronizations using either cluster lock
(reusing swap allocator and existing swap logics) or folio lock (kind
of like page cache). So many parts can be much simplified, I think it
will be at most ~32 bytes per page with a virtual device (including
the intermediate pointers).Will require quite some work though.

The good side with that approach is we will have a much lower memory
overhead and even better performance. And the virtual space part will
be optional, for non virtual setup the memory consumption will be only
8 bytes per page and also dynamically allocated, as discussed at
LSFMM.

So sorry that I still have a few parts undone, looking forward to
posting in about one week, eg. After this weekend it goes well. I'll
also try to check your series first to see how these can be
collaborated better.

A draft version is available here though, just in case anyone is
really anxious to see the code, I wouldn't recommend spend much effort
check it though as it may change rapidly:
https://github.com/ryncsn/linux/tree/kasong/devel/swap-unification

But the good news is the total LOC should be reduced, or at least
won't increase much, as it will unify a lot of swap infrastructures.
So things might be easier to implement after that.
