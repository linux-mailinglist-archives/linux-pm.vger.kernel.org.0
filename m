Can you elaborate a bit what kind of scenario the issue happens (e.g
steps how it reproduces)? It was not 100% clear from the changelog. Also
what the result when the failure happens?

I see there is a script that does something but unfortunately I'm not
fluent in Python so can't extract the steps how the issue can be
reproduced ;-)

One thing that I'm working on is that Linux PCI subsystem misses certain
delays that are needed after D3cold -> D0 transition, otherwise the
device and/or link may not be ready before we access it. What you are
experiencing sounds similar. I wonder if you could try the following
patch and see if it makes any difference?
