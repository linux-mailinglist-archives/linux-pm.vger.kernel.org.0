+ Kevin, Vignesh and few colleagues at TI who have been working on this as
well.

Any further luck on this?

I have also been working on something similar[1] but on an A53 core on
TI-K3 AM62x processor.

What I was seeing is in a multi core system (2 or more) all cores don't
enter the idle-state simultaneously. There's something keeping atleast 1
core always busy. However I could definitely see entry into TF-A from 1
core at a time.
I then switched to a single core system to see if we were atall able to
enter TF-A when only 1 core was available for linux, it turned out that
with the "local-timer-stop" property that we have, this is never
possible.

See this chunk in the kernel cpuidle driver:
	if (broadcast && tick_broadcast_enter()) {

When I dug deeper into tick_broadcast_enter it always returns something
non zero and hence in my case it was entering the if block and tried to
find a deepest state. Then the deepest state would always return WFI and
not the idle-state I had added.

What we found out was on our kernel we end up using 

kernel/time/tick-broadcast-hrtimer.c 

This always seems to be keeping atleast 1 CPU busy and prevents idle.
If we remove the local-timer-stop it was helping us, but we still need
to dig into the full impact of what that entails and I am still
interested in finding out how so many other users of similar idle-state
implementation are able to do so without trouble.

Arm64 recommends to use arch_timer instead of external timers. Once we
enter el3, timer interrupts to el1 is blocked and hence it's equivalent
to local-timer-stop, so it does make sense to keep this property, but
then how are others able to enter idle-states for all plugged CPUs at
the same time?

I had asked a similar qn. on IRC [2], but didn't get much response. I
am still interested in finding out what the right thing to do here is.
