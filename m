Hi Bjorn,

Thanks for the feedback.

Actually, if I understand correctly the below commit [1] and the core
[2] & [3], PCI device fixups can happen at any time, including at the
_noirq phase where, obviously, the PCI controller must be already
setup.

I don't think changing this behavior is a viable solution and I would
not see it as a "PCI core could do better" alternative.

    PCI: mvebu: Add suspend/resume support

    Add suspend/resume support for the mvebu PCIe host driver.  Without
    this commit, the system will panic at resume time when PCIe devices
    are connected.

    Note that we have to use the ->suspend_noirq() and ->resume_noirq()
    hooks, because at resume time, the PCI fixups are done at
    ->resume_noirq() time, so the PCIe controller has to be ready at
    this point.

Indeed. I would like to sort out the above technical point before
sending a v3 with this typo corrected.


Thanks,
