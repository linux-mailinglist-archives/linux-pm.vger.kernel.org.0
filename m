That's true, but it is unclear how this is related to whether or not a
given PCIe port can handle D3cold.  But see below.

I guess, but I'm not sure, that you are trying to kind of validate
HotPlugSupportInD3 by checking if the root port in question actually
can signal wakeup via ACPI and if it cannot, assume that the flag was
set by mistake and so the bridge should not be assumed to be able to
handle D3cold.

That is not unreasonable, but in that case you need to check
wakeup.flags.valid first and then _S0W too, because it can return 0
even if the "valid" flag is set.  And explain in a comment why this is
done.
