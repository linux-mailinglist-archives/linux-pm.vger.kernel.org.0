Huang, I've also done some detailed testing, and while many synthetic
benchmarks seem to show minimal differences between this new frequency
control mechanism and acpi_cpufreq, the general user experience seems a
bit degraded, but most of all, gaming performance in many instances (if
not all) is cut in half. Fully half. 

I have an RTX 3090 and a Ryzen 9 5900X, with 32GB (4x8) DDR4 3600. In
Control with DLSS and RT enabled, on 5.15.rc5 with acpi_cpufreq, I get
120-130 fps at 1440p. The same exact kernel with v3 of AMD_CPPC gives
me 50 fps. GPU usage is still at 100, but the CPU frequency is being
reported as like 5100Mhz*, and other assorted weirdness, but most
importantly the fps is stuck at 50. This is regardless of performance
scheduler (schedutil, ondemand, userspace or performance). 

*My CPU can indeed boost over 5GHz on a single core here and there, but
this was constant and on all cores, so clearly it wasn't accurate.

Also, from the documentation it looks like there's supposed to be a way
to fall back to acpi_cpufreq, but I found no such way to do that. If
AMD_CPPC was built into the kernel, I had to use amd-pstate, there was
no other option. Maybe I misinterpreted and acpi-cpufreq is only able
to be used as a fallback for CPUs that don't support amd-pstate.

I know that gaming on Linux hasn't historically been one of AMD's
priorities with their CPUs, but with the Steam Deck upcoming I would
imagine this is a pretty important use-case, and I've tested multiple
games and they all lose a full 50% performance. I'm happy to test any
revisions or even kernel parameters or whatever else to try and get
this sorted.Â

This would be something I would be interested to try.

This may be an interesting route of investigation, I could potentially
try running a game with `taskset -c 0-7` or something similar.
