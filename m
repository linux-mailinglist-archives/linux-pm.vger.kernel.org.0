I haven't made it work on an HP Z440 or a Lenovo P520. So now I'm
wondering whether having chipsets with TXT support (even if it's turned
off) confuse this point. Sigh. I'd really prefer to use localities than
a PCR, so if it works on client platforms I'd be inclined to say we'll
do a self-test and go for that, and workstation vendors can just
recommend their customers use UPSes or something.

Absolutely no way of guaranteeing that, and enabling this option is
certainly an ABI break.

How many write cycles do we expect the NV to survive? But I'll find a
client system with a TPM and play with locality support there - maybe we
can just avoid this problem anyway.
