Seems weird to me since we're talking about a hot-plug Root Port and
anything at all could be plugged into it.  We're basically saying that
we can assume a property of an arbitrary downstream device based on
something we know about the upstream device.  I'm still not
comfortable with that.

At a minimum we should add a comment about this assumption.  The
existing "... we know the hierarchy behind it supports D3 just fine"
seems a little too strong.

This part seems reasonable to me, as long as we have good confidence
that requiring "HotPlugSupportInD3" + _PRW + _S0W where we used to
require only "HotPlugSupportInD3" is unlikely to break anything.

I can't judge that, but I assume you know that we don't use the
acpi_pci_bridge_d3() result unless _PRW and _S0W exist, so I'll take
your word for it :)
