OK, so they are harmless?

Can't you just block runtime PM from the nouveau driver until this is
understood better? That can be done by calling pm_runtime_forbid() (or
not calling pm_runtime_allow() in the driver). Or in case of PCI driver
you just don't decrease the reference count when probe() ends.

I think that would be much better than blocking any devices behind
Kabylake PCIe root ports from entering D3 (I don't really think the
problem is in the root ports itself but there is something we are
missing when the NVIDIA GPU is put into D3cold or back from there).
