There is a force load option when loading the driver as a module.
This adds the equivalent methodology for the binding path.
Though I suppose you could in fact just force load if the gpio detect 
isn't present.
Thats a good idea, just wasn't the existing driver flow. I can't think 
of any reason why we couldn't do that though.

I'll update the patch and resubmit V3
Will add a note about it in the docs

Please note I'd submitted this incorrectly when using our patch script 
last time, it's now correctly part of the combined patch

Regards
