I would prefer to enable the new interface unconditionally to make it
easier for userspace tools like powertop to use it.

I think the existing and new interfaces could coexist, with the
existing interface being enabled by CONFIG_PCIEASPM_DEBUG as it is
today.  The patch that removes the existing interface is the last in
the series and could easily be dropped.

What is TLP?  Since CONFIG_PCIEASPM is a bool, aspm.o is built in
statically if enabled, so pcie_aspm.policy is effectively a boot-time
kernel parameter, right?  We don't have a plan to remove it.
