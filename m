Great, I'm glad you figured something out because I sure wasn't
getting anywhere!

Maybe this is a tangent, but I can't figure out what
snd_power_change_state() is doing.  It *looks* like it's supposed to
change the PCI power state, but I gave up trying to figure out where
it actually touches the device.

It seems like sound has more magic in power management than other
device types, which makes me wonder if we're not providing the right
interfaces or something.
