we are trying to enable the runtime PM of host bridge here, so that we
can enable runtime PM of the controller.
If this change got accepted the child here(host bridge) runtime pm will
be enabled then i think there will no issue in enabling the runtime pm
of the controller then.

sorry I am not expert of the pm framework here, what we observed is when
client drivers are trying to resume using runtime_get we see the 
controller driver is also getting resume properly with this change.
let me dig in and see in code on how this is happening.

Bjorn has this view on this change in previous v2 version[1]
"My expectation is that adding new functionality should only require
changes in drivers that want to take advantage of it.  For example, if
we add runtime PM support in the controller driver, the result should
be functionally correct even if we don't update drivers for downstream
devices.

If that's not the way it works, I suggest that would be a problem in
the PM framework.

The host bridge might be a special case because we don't have a
separate "host bridge" driver; that code is kind of integrated with
the controller drivers.  So maybe it's OK to do controller + host
bridge runtime PM support at the same time, as long as any time we add
runtime PM to a controller, we sure it's also set up for the host
bridge"
