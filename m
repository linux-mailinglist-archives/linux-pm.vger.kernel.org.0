I did not mean to say that they should bind to the CPU nodes compatible string,
but rather have devices populated from sub-nodes of the CPU / CPU cluster nodes
or from the SoC's 'simple-bus' or whatever makes sense for the specific HW.

Generally, I think there should be something in the DT that populates the
corresponding device, rather than having a virtual device. The device isn't
really virtual, it controls some real HW.

Often it's SoC specific, but that should be fine, right? Or do you mean
something else?

The two examples I gave use a firmware interface to control the CPU's idle
state.

But even for the case you mention here, I'd still argue that the driver controls
some real hardware, just not directly. It controls the semantics and is still HW
specific.

Having a dedicated DT node also makes it easy to provide the resources, e.g.
regulators and clocks.
