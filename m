Why not?

It looks like the capability should be saved by pci_save_state() (it
isn't ATM, which appears to be a mistake) and restored by
pci_restore_state(), so if that is implemented, the saving can be
combined with the disabling in principle.

I cannot answer this question, sorry.

ATM we only know that certain SoCs may not enter the deepest idle
state if PTM is enabled on some PCIe root ports during suspend.

Disabling PTM on those ports while suspending helps and hence the patch.

It doesn't appear to qualify as a "hardware defect".

I'm not following the logic here, sorry again.

First of all, there are systems that never suspend, so why would they
be affected by the remedy (whatever it is)?

Second, it is not about the suspend failing entirely.  It's about
being able to make the system draw less power while suspended.

Generally, if someone said "I can make the system draw less power
while suspended if I disable PCIe feature X during suspend", would you
disregard that?
